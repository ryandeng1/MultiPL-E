{"completions": ["Sure! Below is a complete, self\u2011contained implementation of the `frequency` function that counts how many times the value `x` appears in the vector `a`.  \nIt uses a simple linear scan which is O(n) time and O(1) additional space. If you need a more advanced solution (e.g., for sorted vectors you could use binary search), let me know\u2014otherwise this works for any vector.\n\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n#include <cassert>\n\n// Count how many times `x` occurs in vector `a`.\nlong frequency(const std::vector<long>& a, long x) {\n    long count = 0;                     // accumulator\n    for (long value : a) {              // range\u2011based loop\n        if (value == x) {\n            ++count;                    // found another occurrence\n        }\n    }\n    return count;                       // number of matches\n}\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n1. **Pass-by\u2011const\u2011reference**  \n   The vector is passed as `const std::vector<long>&` instead of by value to avoid an expensive copy.\n\n2. **Return type**  \n   The function returns a `long`. If the vector can be very large, you might want to use `std::size_t` or `std::uint64_t` instead.\n\n3. **Testing**  \n   ```cpp\n   #include <iostream>\n\n   int main() {\n       std::vector<long> v = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5};\n       std::cout << frequency(v, 2) << '\\n'; // prints 3\n   }\n   ```\n\nFeel free to drop this into your codebase or adapt it to your needs!", "Here\u2019s a compact, idiomatic implementation that simply counts how many times `x` appears in the vector:\n\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n\nlong frequency(const std::vector<long>& a, long x)\n{\n    // std::count returns the number of elements equal to x\n    return std::count(a.begin(), a.end(), x);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Pass by const reference**  \n   - `const std::vector<long>& a` prevents the function from making an unnecessary copy of the vector and guarantees that the source vector is not modified.\n\n2. **Using `std::count`**  \n   - The algorithm `std::count` iterates over the range `a.begin()` \u2026 `a.end()` and increments a counter each time it finds an element equal to `x`.  \n   - It works in linear time, `O(n)`.\n\n3. **Return type**  \n   - The function returns a `long`, which matches the type of the elements in the vector and the count itself.\n\n---\n\n#### Alternative manual implementation\n\nIf you prefer an explicit loop (e.g., for learning purposes), you can write:\n\n```cpp\nlong frequency(const std::vector<long>& a, long x)\n{\n    long cnt = 0;\n    for (const auto& val : a) {\n        if (val == x) ++cnt;\n    }\n    return cnt;\n}\n```\n\nBoth versions are equivalent in terms of performance and correctness. Feel free to use whichever you find clearer!", "Here is a simple, efficient, and idiomatic implementation of the `frequency` function.  \nIt uses `std::count` from the Standard Library, which is already highly optimised and tested.\n\n```cpp\n#include <algorithm>   // std::count\n#include <vector>\n\n// Count how many times `x` occurs in the vector `a`\n// The vector is taken by const reference to avoid an unnecessary copy.\nlong frequency(const std::vector<long>& a, long x)\n{\n    // std::count iterates over the range and counts elements equal to `x`.\n    return static_cast<long>(std::count(a.begin(), a.end(), x));\n}\n```\n\n### Why this implementation?\n\n| Requirement | How it satisfies it |\n|-------------|---------------------|\n| **Correctness** | `std::count` compares each element to `x` using `==` and increments the counter. |\n| **Time complexity** | `O(n)` where `n` is the size of the vector \u2013 you need to examine every element at least once. |\n| **Space complexity** | `O(1)` \u2013 only a few variables are stored locally. |\n| **Safety** | The function accepts the vector by `const&`, so the caller\u2019s vector isn\u2019t copied, preserving performance. |\n| **Portability & maintainability** | Relies on the Standard Library rather than a manual loop; easier to audit and less error\u2011prone. |\n\n### Alternative: Manual loop\n\nIf you prefer (for educational purposes), a manual loop looks like this:\n\n```cpp\nlong frequency(const std::vector<long>& a, long x)\n{\n    long cnt = 0;\n    for (const auto& v : a)\n        if (v == x) ++cnt;\n    return cnt;\n}\n```\n\nBoth variants produce identical results. Use the `std::count` version for brevity and clarity."]}
