{"completions": ["Here\u2019s a minimal, easy\u2011to\u2011read correction that follows the described rules:\n\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nstd::vector<long> eat(long number, long need, long remaining) {\n    // The rabbit will eat as many of the needed carrots as are available.\n    long actually_eaten = std::min(need, remaining);\n\n    // Total eaten = what was already eaten + what was just eaten.\n    long total_eaten = number + actually_eaten;\n\n    // Carrots left in the stock.\n    long left = remaining - actually_eaten;\n\n    return {total_eaten, left};\n}\n```\n\nThe logic is a straightforward application of the problem statement: take the lesser of the required amount and what\u2019s left, add it to the current total, and subtract it from the remaining stock.", "```cpp\n#include <vector>\n\nstd::vector<long> eat(long number, long need, long remaining) {\n    // how many carrots we can actually eat this session\n    long canEat = std::min(need, remaining);\n    long totalEaten = number + canEat;   // total eaten so far\n    long left = remaining - canEat;      // carrots left in stock\n\n    return {totalEaten, left};\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. `canEat` is the minimum between how many carrots the rabbit *needs* (`need`) and how many carrots are still *available* (`remaining`).  \n2. The rabbit will eat `canEat` carrots, so the new total is `number + canEat`.  \n3. The remaining stock after this meal becomes `remaining - canEat`.  \n4. Return these two values in a `std::vector<long>` as required.", "```cpp\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nstd::vector<long> eat(long number, long need, long remaining) {\n    // How many carrots can we actually eat?  \n    // It's the lesser of what we need and how many are left in stock.\n    long eatable = std::min(need, remaining);\n\n    // Total carrots eaten after this meal.\n    long totalEaten = number + eatable;\n\n    // Remaining carrots after eating.\n    long left = remaining - eatable;\n\n    return {totalEaten, left};\n}\n```\n\nThis function follows the rules:\n- It eats as many carrots as possible, but never more than `remaining`.\n- The returned vector contains the new total number of eaten carrots and how many carrots are left."]}
