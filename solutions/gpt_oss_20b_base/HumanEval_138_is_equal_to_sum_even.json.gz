{"completions": ["**Explanation**\n\nFour positive even numbers are all multiples of 2, so their sum is also a multiple of 2.  \nThe smallest possible sum is \\(2+2+2+2 = 8\\).  \nIf \\(n\\) is even and at least 8, we can always construct such a representation:  \n* choose three numbers as 2 (the smallest even positive) and the fourth as  \n  \\(n-6\\), which will also be positive and even because the difference of two even numbers is even.\n\nThus the condition reduces to:\n```cpp\nn % 2 == 0 && n >= 8\n```\n\n**Code**\n\n```cpp\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// returns true if `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers\nbool is_equal_to_sum_even(long n) {\n    // The smallest four positive evens sum to 8 and the sum must be even.\n    return (n % 2 == 0) && (n >= 8);\n}\n\n// Optional main for quick testing\nint main() {\n    vector<long> tests = {4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16};\n\n    for (auto n : tests) {\n        cout << \"is_equal_to_sum_even(\" << n << \") = \" \n             << (is_equal_to_sum_even(n) ? \"true\" : \"false\") << endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis function runs in constant time, O(1).", "Here is a complete implementation of the requested function:\n\n```cpp\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\n/// Checks if an integer `n` can be expressed as a sum of exactly\n/// four positive even numbers.\n///\n/// Observation:\n///   * The smallest positive even integer is 2.\n///   * Therefore the smallest possible sum of four such numbers is\n///     2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.\n///   * All further sums are obtained by adding multiples of 2 to\n///     this base, so the sum must be even and at least 8.\n///\n/// Hence `n` can be expressed as required iff it is even and\n/// greater than or equal to 8.\nbool is_equal_to_sum_even(long n) {\n    return n >= 8 && n % 2 == 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Quick Test\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    assert(is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == false);\n    assert(is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == false);\n    assert(is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == true);\n    assert(is_equal_to_sum_even(10) == true);\n    assert(is_equal_to_sum_even(11) == false);\n    cout << \"All tests passed.\" << endl;\n}\n```\n\nCompile with `g++ -std=c++17` and run \u2013 it prints `All tests passed.` showing that the function behaves as expected.", "Here\u2019s a concise implementation that follows the specification:\n\n```cpp\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\n// Determine whether `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four\n// positive even integers.\n//   - Each addend must be \u2265 2 and even.\n//   - Hence the smallest possible sum is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.\n//   - Any even number \u2265 8 can be written in that way\n//     (e.g.: 8 = 2+2+2+2, 10 = 2+2+2+4, 12 = 2+2+4+4, \u2026).\n//\n// Thus the function is true iff `n` is even and n >= 8.\nbool is_equal_to_sum_even(long n) {\n    return (n % 2 == 0) && (n >= 8);\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**\n\n- **Evenness**: The sum of even numbers is always even, so `n` must be even.\n- **Minimum sum**: With four positive even numbers, the minimum possible sum is \\(2+2+2+2 = 8\\). Any even number below 8 cannot meet the requirements.\n- **Constructability**: For every even \\(n \\ge 8\\) we can construct a representation, e.g.:\n\n  ```\n  n = 8: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2\n  n = 10: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4\n  n = 12: 2 + 2 + 4 + 4\n  \u2026\n  ```\n\nHence the condition `n % 2 == 0 && n >= 8` is sufficient and necessary."]}
