Passed as const reference to avoid a copy.\n * @return size_t The number of characters in the string.\n */\nsize_t count_charac(const std::string& str)\n{\n    // The standard library guarantees that size() is O(1).\n    return str.size();\n}\n\n/* If you must return a long (for legacy reasons or an API contract), you can do:\n *\n * long count_charac(const std::string& str)\n * {\n *     return static_cast<long>(str.size());\n * }\n */\n```\n\n### Why this works\n\n* `size()` returns the number of characters stored in `std::string`.  \n* Passing as `const std::string&` avoids a copy, which is especially important for long strings.  \n* `size_t` is the idiomatic type for object sizes in C++; using it avoids potential overflow and signed\u2011unsigned comparison warnings.  \n\nFeel free to drop the `assert` you had \u2013 counting characters is inherently safe and doesn\u2019t require an assertion unless you have some domain\u2011specific precondition (e.g., `str` should never be empty).", "Sure!\u202fA \u201ctotal count of characters\u201d is just the length of the string.  \nBelow is a tiny, self\u2011contained implementation that returns that length as a `long`.  \nYou can copy\u2011paste it into your file and use it wherever you need it.\n\n```cpp\n#include <string>   // std::string\n#include <cstddef>  // std::size_t\n\n// Count the total number of characters (including spaces, punctuation, etc.) in a string.\nlong count_charac(const std::string& str) {\n    // std::string::size() returns a size_t (an unsigned integer type).\n    // We cast it to long because the function signature asks for a long.\n    return static_cast<long>(str.size());\n}\n```\n\n### Why this works\n\n* `std::string::size()` (or `length()`) gives the number of characters in the string.  \n* We take a **const reference** to avoid copying the string, both for efficiency and safety.  \n* The result is cast to `long` to match the return type you requested.\n\nYou can now use `count_charac(myString)` in your code to get the total character count."]}
