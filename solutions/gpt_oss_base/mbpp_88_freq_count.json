Thus each element\u2019s count is gathered correctly.\n\n4. **`return freq;`**  \n   The filled map is returned by value. Because of Return\u2011Value\u2011Optimization (RVO) the copy cost is usually negligible.\n\n---\n\n#### Example usage\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main()\n{\n    std::vector<long> v = {1, 2, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3};\n    std::map<long,long> f = freq_count(v);\n\n    for (const auto& p : f)\n        std::cout << p.first << \" appears \" << p.second << \" times\\n\";\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n1 appears 3 times\n2 appears 2 times\n3 appears 1 times\n5 appears 1 times\n```\n\nFeel free to replace `std::map` with `std::unordered_map` if you don\u2019t need the keys to be sorted and want a slightly better average\u2011case performance.", "Sure!  \nBelow is a complete and self\u2011contained implementation of `freq_count` that:\n\n1. **Takes a `std::vector<long>` as input.**  \n2. **Counts how many times each value appears.**  \n3. **Returns a `std::map<long,long>`** where the key is the element and the value is its frequency.\n\nI\u2019ll also show a short `main()` that demonstrates the function and some simple tests.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <map>\n\n// -----------------------------------------------------------------\n// Function: freq_count\n// -----------------------------------------------------------------\n/// \\brief  Return a map containing the frequency of each element\n///         in the given vector.\n///\n/// \\param  vec  The vector of long integers to analyze.\n/// \\return      A std::map where `key` is the element and\n///              `value` is the number of times it appears in `vec`.\n///\n/// Notes\n/// -----\n/// * The function runs in O(n log m) time, where `n` is the\n///   vector size and `m` is the number of distinct elements\n///   (normally `m <= n`).  \n/// * Uses standard containers only \u2013 no external libraries.\n/// * If the vector is empty, an empty map is returned.\nstd::map<long, long> freq_count(const std::vector<long>& vec)\n{\n    std::map<long, long> freqMap;          // key: element, value: count\n\n    for (const long& value : vec) {\n        ++freqMap[value];                  // default constructed value is 0\n    }\n\n    return freqMap;\n}\n\n// -----------------------------------------------------------------\n// Demo / simple tests\n// -----------------------------------------------------------------\nint main()\n{\n    // Example 1\n    std::vector<long> v1{1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3};\n    auto freq1 = freq_count(v1);\n    std::cout << \"Example 1 frequencies:\\n\";\n    for (const auto& [key, val] : freq1)\n        std::cout << key << \" : \" << val << '\\n';\n\n    // Example 2 (with negative numbers and zeros)\n    std::vector<long> v2{-1, 0, 0, -1, 5, 5, 5};\n    auto freq2 = freq_count(v2);\n    std::cout << \"\\nExample 2 frequencies:\\n\";\n    for (const auto& [key, val] : freq2)\n        std::cout << key << \" : \" << val << '\\n';\n\n    // Example 3 (empty vector)\n    std::vector<long> v3{};\n    auto freq3 = freq_count(v3);\n    std::cout << \"\\nExample 3 (empty) frequencies size: \" << freq3.size() << '\\n';\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### TL;DR\n\n- **Input**: `std::vector<long> list1`  \n- **Output**: `std::map<long, long>` with `{element -> frequency}`  \n- **Complexity**: `O(n log m)` (the log comes from the map\u2019s insert/find operations)\n\nFeel free to drop this function into any codebase that needs a simple frequency counter.
