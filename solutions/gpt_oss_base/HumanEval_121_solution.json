Iterate through the vector only over even indices (`i += 2`).\n2. Check if the element at that index is odd (`abs(value) % 2 != 0` to handle negative numbers if needed).\n3. Accumulate the result in `sum`.\n\nThis produces the expected results:\n\n- `{5,8,7,1}` \u2192 5 + 7 = **12**\n- `{3,3,3,3,3}` \u2192 3 + 3 + 3 = **9**\n- `{30,13,24,321}` \u2192 0 (no odd numbers at even indices)  \n\nFeel free to drop this function into your project.", "**Solution Explanation**\n\nWe must sum all *odd* elements that are stored in *even\u2011indexed* positions of a vector  \n(`index 0, 2, 4, \u2026`).  \nThe examples confirm:  \n\n* `[5,8,7,1]` \u2192 odd elements at indices `0` and `2` \u2192 `5 + 7 = 12`  \n* `[3,3,3,3,3]` \u2192 indices `0,2,4` \u2192 `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`  \n* `[30,13,24,321]` \u2192 indices `0,2` \u2192 both are even \u2192 `0`\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward:\n\n1. Iterate over the vector, stepping by 2 (so we visit only even indices).\n2. If the element is odd (`x % 2 != 0`), add it to a running total.\n3. Return the total.\n\nThe complexity is `O(n)` in time and `O(1)` in additional space.\n\n```cpp\n#include <vector>\n\nlong solution(std::vector<long> lst) {\n    long sum = 0;\n    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < lst.size(); i += 2) {\n        if (lst[i] % 2 != 0)    // odd element\n            sum += lst[i];\n    }\n    return sum;\n}\n```\n\nThis function follows exactly the behaviour described by the problem statement."]}
