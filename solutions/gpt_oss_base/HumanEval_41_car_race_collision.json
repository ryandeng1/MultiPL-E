For each of the `n` right\u2011moving cars we can pair it with\nany of the `n` left\u2011moving cars.  This yields `n \u00d7 n = n\u00b2` distinct collision\nevents.\n\nTherefore the number of collisions is simply the square of the number of cars\nin each group.\n\n---\n\n#### Function\n\n```cpp\nlong long car_race_collision(long long n) {\n    // Each of the n right\u2011moving cars collides with each of the n left\u2011moving cars.\n    return n * n;\n}\n```\n\nThe function returns a 64\u2011bit integer because the result can be as large as\n`n\u00b2`, which may exceed the range of a 32\u2011bit integer for large `n`.\n\n---\n\n#### Correctness Proof\n\nWe prove that the function returns the exact number of collisions.\n\n*Let `R = {r1, r2, \u2026, rn}` be the set of right\u2011moving cars and  \n`L = {l1, l2, \u2026, ln}` be the set of left\u2011moving cars.*\n\n1. **Each pair `(ri, lj)` collides.**  \n   All cars travel in the same direction with the same speed.  \n   A right\u2011moving car is ahead of all left\u2011moving cars initially, so as time\n   progresses the left\u2011moving car will eventually catch up to the right\u2011moving\n   car, resulting in exactly one collision.\n\n2. **No two different pairs collide at the same \u201croad point\u201d.**  \n   The problem only asks for the number of collision events, not their positions.\n   Each pair is distinct, so each collision event is counted separately.\n\nFrom 1 and 2 the total number of distinct collisions is the cardinality of\n`R \u00d7 L`, which is `|R| \u00b7 |L| = n \u00b7 n = n\u00b2`.\n\nThe function returns `n * n`, which equals this number.  Hence the function\nis correct.\n\n---\n\n#### Complexity Analysis\n\nThe computation is a single multiplication, therefore\n\n```\nTime   : O(1)\nMemory : O(1)\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Reference Implementation (C++17)\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\n/*\n * Computes the number of collisions between two symmetric groups of cars.\n *\n * @param n Number of cars in each group (left\u2011to\u2011right and right\u2011to\u2011left).\n * @return  Total number of collision events (n\u00b2).\n */\nlong long car_race_collision(long long n) {\n    return n * n;\n}\n\n// Example usage\nint main() {\n    long long n;\n    cin >> n;\n    cout << car_race_collision(n) << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe program reads an integer `n` from standard input and outputs `n\u00b2`, which\nis the required number of collisions."]}
