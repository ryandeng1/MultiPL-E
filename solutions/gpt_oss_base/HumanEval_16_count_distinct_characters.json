Iterate over each character in the string.  \n2. Convert the character to lower case so that `'X'` and `'x'` are treated as the same.  \n3. Insert the converted character into an `unordered_set<char>`, which automatically keeps only unique values.  \n4. The final size of the set is the number of distinct characters, returned as a `long` as requested."]}
