The solution checks for three cases:\n1. If all three integers are equal, return 3.\n2. If exactly two integers are equal (and the third is different), return 2.\n3. If all three integers are different, return 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conditions using simple comparisons. The function is implemented in Rust as specified.\n\n```rust\nfn test_three_equal(x: isize, y: isize, z: isize) -> isize {\n    if x == y && y == z {\n        3\n    } else if x == y || y == z || x == z {\n        2\n    } else {\n        0\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The first condition checks if all three integers are equal (`x == y && y == z`). If true, it returns `3`.\n- The second condition checks if at least two integers are equal (`x == y || y == z || x == z`). If true (and the first condition failed), it returns `2`.\n- The `else` clause handles the case where all integers are different, returning `0`.\n\nThis solution correctly counts the number of equal numbers (i.e., the size of the largest group of equal numbers) for three integers, matching the problem's requirements. The term \"rsthon\" appears to be a typo for \"Rust\" based on the function signature and context.", "\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of equal numbers among three integers. The solution checks if all three numbers are equal (returning 3), if exactly two are equal (returning 2), or if all are different (returning 0).\n\nHere's the Rust implementation:\n\n```rust\nfn test_three_equal(x: isize, y: isize, z: isize) -> isize {\n    if x == y && y == z {\n        3\n    } else if x == y || x == z || y == z {\n        2\n    } else {\n        0\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **All three equal (`x == y && y == z`)**: Returns `3`.\n- **Exactly two equal (`x == y || x == z || y == z`)**: Returns `2` (this condition is checked after the all-equal case to avoid incorrect results for all-equal numbers).\n- **All different**: Returns `0`.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all possible cases with clear and concise logic. The function uses Rust's expression-based `if` statements for readability and correctness.\n\n**Example Test Cases:**\n- `test_three_equal(1, 1, 1)` \u2192 `3`\n- `test_three_equal(1, 1, 2)` \u2192 `2`\n- `test_three_equal(1, 2, 3)` \u2192 `0`", "\n\nThe function `test_three_equal` counts the number of equal numbers among three given integers by checking for the following scenarios:\n1. If all three integers are equal, return 3.\n2. If exactly two integers are equal (and the third is different), return 2.\n3. If all three integers are distinct, return 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all possible cases with clear conditions. The solution is written in Rust as requested.\n\n```rust\nfn test_three_equal(x: isize, y: isize, z: isize) -> isize {\n    if x == y && y == z {\n        3\n    } else if x == y || x == z || y == z {\n        2\n    } else {\n        0\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The first condition checks if all three numbers are equal (`x == y && y == z`). If true, it returns `3`.\n- The second condition checks if any two numbers are equal (`x == y || x == z || y == z`). If true (and the first condition failed), it returns `2`.\n- The final `else` case handles all distinct numbers, returning `0`.\n\nThis implementation is concise, efficient, and correctly addresses the problem statement. The function name `test_three_equal` aligns with the problem's context (a Rust function for this specific task)."]}
