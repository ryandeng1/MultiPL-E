The function should return `None` if the angle is larger than 360 degrees; otherwise, it should return the area as a `f64` value wrapped in `Some`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The area of a sector is calculated using the formula \\((\\text{angle} / 360) \\times \\pi \\times \\text{radius}^2\\). The key requirement is to return `None` if the angle is strictly greater than 360 degrees.\n2. **Input Handling**: The function takes two `isize` parameters: `r` (radius) and `a` (angle in degrees).\n3. **Check for Valid Angle**: Before computing the area, we check if the angle `a` is greater than 360. If so, we immediately return `None`.\n4. **Area Calculation**: For valid angles (\u2264 360), we convert the radius and angle to `f64` for precise floating-point calculations. We then compute the area using the formula and return it as `Some(area)`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn sector_area(r: isize, a: isize) -> Option<f64> {\n    if a > 360 {\n        None\n    } else {\n        Some((a as f64) / 360.0 * std::f64::consts::PI * (r as f64).powi(2))\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Angle Check**: The function first checks if the angle `a` is greater than 360. If true, it returns `None` as specified.\n2. **Conversion to Float**: The radius `r` and angle `a` are converted to `f64` to ensure precise arithmetic operations.\n3. **Area Calculation**: The area is computed using the formula \\((\\text{angle} / 360) \\times \\pi \\times \\text{radius}^2\\). The `std::f64::consts::PI` provides a high-precision value of \\(\\pi\\).\n4. **Result Handling**: The computed area is wrapped in `Some` and returned. This ensures the function adheres to the requirement of returning `Option<f64>`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the angle condition and computes the sector area with precision, handling all edge cases as specified. The solution is both optimal and straightforward, leveraging Rust's type system and standard library constants for correctness.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the area of a sector of a circle given its radius and the central angle in degrees. The function should return `None` if the angle is larger than 360 degrees; otherwise, it should return the area as a `f64` value wrapped in an `Option<f64>`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Angle Validity**: First, we check if the given angle `a` is larger than 360 degrees. If it is, we immediately return `None` since the sector area for angles beyond 360 degrees is not defined in this context.\n2. **Convert to Float**: Convert the radius `r` and angle `a` from `isize` to `f64` to perform floating-point arithmetic.\n3. **Calculate Sector Area**: The formula for the area of a sector is \\((\\text{angle} / 360) \\times \\pi \\times \\text{radius}^2\\). We compute this using the converted values and the constant \\(\\pi\\) from the standard library.\n4. **Return Result**: If the angle is valid, we return the computed area as `Some(f64)`; otherwise, we return `None`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn sector_area(r: isize, a: isize) -> Option<f64> {\n    if a > 360 {\n        None\n    } else {\n        Some((a as f64) / 360.0 * std::f64::consts::PI * (r as f64) * (r as f64))\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Angle Check**: The function starts by checking if the angle `a` exceeds 360 degrees. If it does, the function returns `None` immediately.\n2. **Type Conversion**: The radius `r` and angle `a` are converted to `f64` to ensure accurate floating-point calculations. This is necessary because the sector area formula involves multiplication and division with floating-point numbers.\n3. **Area Calculation**: The sector area is calculated using the formula \\((a / 360) \\times \\pi \\times r^2\\). Here, `a` is divided by 360.0 to get the fraction of the circle, multiplied by \\(\\pi\\) (from `std::f64::consts::PI`), and then by the square of the radius `r`.\n4. **Result Handling**: The result of the area calculation is wrapped in `Some` to form an `Option<f64>`, which is returned. This ensures the function adheres to the requirement of returning `None` for invalid angles (those > 360 degrees) and the computed area otherwise.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for valid input angles and computes the sector area using precise floating-point arithmetic, ensuring correctness for all valid inputs within the problem constraints.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that calculates the area of a sector given the radius and the angle (in degrees).
