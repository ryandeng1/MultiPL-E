The solution involves leveraging Rust's built-in methods to efficiently determine the length of the outer vector.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The function `count_list` takes a `Vec<Vec<isize>>` as input and returns the number of inner vectors (sub-vectors) in the outer vector. The key observation here is that the number of inner vectors is simply the length of the outer vector.\n2. **Insight**: In Rust, the `len()` method of a `Vec<T>` returns the number of elements in the vector as a `usize`. Since the problem requires the return type to be `isize`, we convert the `usize` value to `isize`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves directly using the `len()` method on the input vector and casting the result to `isize`.
