It would be more accurate to name it `octagonal_number(n)` or similar. However, the problem explicitly asks for this function name, so we follow it.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Example Usage\n\n```rust\nprintln!(\"The 1st octagonal number is: {}\", is_octagonal(1)); // 1\nprintln!(\"The 2nd octagonal number is: {}\", is_octagonal(2)); // 8\nprintln!(\"The 3rd octagonal number is: {}\", is_octagonal(3)); // 21\n```\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer\n\n```rust\nfn is_octagonal(n: isize) -> isize {\n    3 * n * n - 2 * n\n}\n```", "\n\nTo find the nth octagonal number, we use the mathematical formula derived from the properties of octagonal numbers. The nth octagonal number is given by:\n\n$$\nO(n) = n \\times (3n - 2)\n$$\n\nThis formula is derived from the general formula for polygonal numbers and has been verified with known values (e.g., $ O(1) = 1 $, $ O(2) = 8 $, $ O(3) = 21 $).\n\nThe function `is_octagonal` is defined to compute this value for a given integer `n`. Note that although the function name may suggest a predicate (e.g., checking if a number is octagonal), the problem specifies that it should return the nth octagonal number.\n\nHere's the implementation in Rust:\n\n```rust\nfn is_octagonal(n: isize) -> isize {\n    n * (3 * n - 2)\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The expression `3 * n - 2` computes the term inside the parentheses.\n- Multiplying this result by `n` gives the nth octagonal number.\n- This implementation efficiently computes the result using basic arithmetic operations.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```rust\nprintln!(\"{}\", is_octagonal(1)); // Output: 1\nprintln!(\"{}\", is_octagonal(2)); // Output: 8\nprintln!(\"{}\", is_octagonal(3)); // Output: 21\n```\n\nThis function correctly returns the nth octagonal number for any valid positive integer `n`. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n```rust\nfn is_octagonal(n: isize) -> isize {\n    n * (3 * n - 2)\n}\n```", "\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the **nth octagonal number**, we start by understanding the mathematical definition of octagonal numbers. The **nth octagonal number** is defined by the formula:\n\n$$\nO(n) = n \\times (3n - 2)\n$$\n\nThis formula generates the sequence of octagonal numbers: 1, 8, 21, 40, 65, ...\n\n---\n\n### Clarification on the Function Name\n\nThe function name `is_octagonal` is slightly misleading in this context. It suggests that the function checks whether a number is octagonal (i.e., a predicate), but the problem statement explicitly asks to **\"find the nth octagonal number\"**. Given the context and the expected behavior, it's clear that the intended purpose of the function is to **compute** the nth octagonal number, not to check if a number is octagonal.\n\nTherefore, the function name `is_octagonal` appears to be a misnomer or typo in the problem statement. However, since the problem specifies this function name and signature, we will proceed under the assumption that the function is meant to return the **nth octagonal number**.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere's the correct implementation of the function:\n\n```rust\nfn is_octagonal(n: isize) -> isize {\n    n * (3 * n - 2)\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` (the position in the sequence) and returns the corresponding **nth octagonal number** using the formula $ O(n) = n \\times (3n - 2) $.\n\n---\n\n### Example Usage\n\n- `is_octagonal(1)` \u2192 `1`\n- `is_octagonal(2)` \u2192 `8`\n- `is_octagonal(3)` \u2192 `21`\n- `is_octagonal(4)` \u2192 `40`\n\nThese match the known sequence of octagonal numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```rust\nfn is_octagonal(n: isize) -> isize {\n    n * (3 * n - 2)\n}\n```"]}
