The key insight here is recognizing that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be calculated using a well-known mathematical formula: $ \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} $. This formula allows us to compute the sum in constant time $ O(1) $, which is significantly more efficient than iterating through each number from 1 to `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires summing integers from 1 to `n` for a given positive integer `n`. The examples provided confirm that the sum follows the pattern $ \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} $.\n2. **Intuition**: Using the mathematical formula avoids the need for a loop, thus optimizing the solution to run in constant time.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Directly apply the formula $ \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} $ to compute the sum. This ensures the solution is both time and space efficient.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in $ O(1) $ time since it involves only basic arithmetic operations. The space complexity is also $ O(1) $ as no additional data structures are used.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn sum_to_n(n: isize) -> isize {\n    n * (n + 1) / 2\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `sum_to_n` takes an `isize` parameter `n` and returns an `isize` result.\n- **Mathematical Formula**: The expression `n * (n + 1) / 2` computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. For example:\n  - When `n = 30`, the calculation is $ 30 \\times 31 / 2 = 465 $.\n  - When `n = 100`, the calculation is $ 100 \\times 101 / 2 = 5050 $.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach avoids loops and leverages arithmetic operations for constant-time computation, making it highly efficient even for large values of `n`.\n\nThis solution efficiently meets the problem requirements by utilizing a direct mathematical formula to compute the sum without unnecessary iterations.", "\n\nThe function `sum_to_n` calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the mathematical formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers: `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This formula is efficient and works for non-negative integers (as the problem examples and context imply positive inputs). \n\nThe solution handles the given examples correctly:\n- `sum_to_n(30)` returns `465`\n- `sum_to_n(100)` returns `5050`\n- `sum_to_n(5)` returns `15`\n- `sum_to_n(10)` returns `55`\n- `sum_to_n(1)` returns `1`\n\nThe implementation uses integer arithmetic, and since `n * (n + 1)` is always even, the division by 2 is exact without truncation. The problem specifies positive inputs in the examples, so no additional checks for negative values are necessary for the test cases provided.\n\n```rust\nfn sum_to_n(n: isize) -> isize {\n    n * (n + 1) / 2\n}\n```", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of all integers from 1 to a given positive integer `n`.

The examples provided confirm that the solution must return specific values for different inputs (e.g., `sum_to_n(30)` returns 465).\n2. **Key Insight**: The sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be computed using the formula \\( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\). This formula is derived from arithmetic series properties and ensures the solution is both time and space efficient.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Using the mathematical formula avoids the need for a loop, which would be less efficient (especially for large `n`). The formula is computed in constant time \\(O(1)\\), making it optimal.\n4. **Implementation**: The function `sum_to_n` takes an `isize` parameter `n` and returns the result of the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. The expression is evaluated using integer arithmetic, which is exact because the product `n * (n + 1)` is always even (as either `n` or `n + 1` is even), ensuring no fractional results.\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging a fundamental mathematical insight, providing the correct result for all valid inputs as demonstrated by the provided examples."]}
