The function correctly filters out non-negative numbers (including zero) and returns only negative integers.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that filters out negative numbers from a given vector of `isize` values and returns a new vector containing only those negative numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves processing a vector of integers (specifically `isize` in Rust) to extract all negative numbers. The solution requires iterating through each element of the input vector, checking if it is negative, and collecting those elements into a new vector.\n2. **Intuition**: By leveraging Rust's built-in iterator methods, we can efficiently filter the elements. The `iter()` method creates an iterator over the elements of the vector, and the `filter()` method is used to retain only the elements that satisfy a condition (in this case, being negative).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Use `iter()` to get an iterator over the elements of the input vector.\n   - Apply `filter()` with a closure that checks if an element is less than 0 (negative).\n   - Collect the filtered elements into a new vector using `collect()`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input vector. This is because each element is checked exactly once. The space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of negative elements in the input vector (the size of the output vector).\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn neg_nos(list1: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    list1.into_iter()\n         .filter(|&x| x < 0)\n         .collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **`list1.into_iter()`**: Converts the input vector `list1` into an iterator. The `into_iter()` method consumes the vector to create the iterator, which is efficient.\n2. **`.filter(|&x| x < 0)`**: Filters the iterator to include only elements `x` that are negative (i.e., `x < 0`). The `&x` in the closure allows the function to borrow the element without moving it.\n3. **`.collect()`**: Collects the filtered elements into a new vector. The `collect()` method is used to gather the results of the filter into a `Vec<isize>`.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input vector to extract negative numbers using Rust's iterator patterns, ensuring optimal performance and correctness. The solution is concise, readable, and leverages Rust's strong type system and iterator capabilities."]}
