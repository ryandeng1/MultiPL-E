The solution involves iterating through each character of the string and transforming it based on specific conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires swapping whitespace characters and underscores in the input string. Specifically:\n   - Any whitespace character (as defined by Rust's `is_whitespace` method) should be replaced with an underscore (`_`).\n   - Any underscore (`_`) should be replaced with a space (` `).\n   - All other characters remain unchanged.\n   \n2. **Intuition**: By processing each character in the string sequentially, we can check if it is a whitespace character or an underscore and replace it accordingly. This ensures that the transformation is done in a single pass through the string without any side effects.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Convert the input string into a sequence of characters using `chars()`.\n   - For each character:\n     - If it is a whitespace character, replace it with `_`.\n     - Else if it is an underscore, replace it with a space.\n     - Otherwise, keep the character as it is.\n   - Collect the transformed characters into a new string.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the transformed string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn replace_spaces(text: String) -> String {\n    text.chars()\n        .map(|c| {\n            if c.is_whitespace() {\n                '_'\n            } else if c == '_' {\n                ' '\n            } else {\n                c\n            }\n        })\n        .collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Character Processing**: The function processes each character in the input string using `text.chars()`, which returns an iterator over each character in the string.\n- **Condition Checks**: For each character:\n  - If the character is a whitespace (e.g., space, tab, newline), it is replaced with `_`.\n  - If the character is an underscore (`_`), it is replaced with a space (` `).\n  - All other characters are left unchanged.\n- **Result Construction**: The transformed characters are collected into a new `String` using `collect()`, which efficiently builds the result string from the iterator.\n\nThis approach ensures that the transformation is done efficiently and correctly, handling all specified cases while leaving other characters intact. The solution is both optimal and straightforward, leveraging Rust's built-in string and character processing capabilities.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to replace every space character (`' '`) with an underscore (`'_'`) and every underscore (`'_'`) with a space character (`' '`), while leaving all other characters unchanged. The solution involves processing each character in the input string and transforming it according to the specified rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires swapping space characters and underscore characters in a given string. The key observation is that each character in the string must be checked:\n   - If the character is a space (`' '`), replace it with an underscore (`'_'`).\n   - If the character is an underscore (`'_'`), replace it with a space (`' '`).\n   - All other characters remain unchanged.\n   \n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each character in the string, we can apply the transformation rules on the fly. This ensures that each character is processed exactly once, leading to an efficient solution with linear time complexity, O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves:\n   - Converting the input string into a sequence of characters using `chars()`.\n   - For each character, use a match statement to determine the transformed character:\n     - Space becomes underscore.\n     - Underscore becomes space.\n     - Any other character remains the same.\n   - Collect the transformed characters into a new string.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution processes each character exactly once, resulting in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the transformed string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn replace_spaces(text: String) -> String {\n    text.chars()\n        .map(|c| match c {\n            ' ' => '_',\n            '_' => ' ',\n            _ => c,\n        })\n        .collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a `String` as input.\n2. **Character Processing**: Using `text.chars()`, the input string is converted into an iterator of individual characters.\n3. **Transformation**: For each character:\n   - If it is a space (`' '`), it is replaced with an underscore (`'_'`).\n   - If it is an underscore (`'_'`), it is replaced with a space (`' '`).\n   - All other characters are left unchanged.\n4. **Result Construction**: The transformed characters are collected into a new `String` using `collect()`, which is then returned as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the transformation by processing each character in a single pass, ensuring optimal performance and correctness for the given problem constraints.

The solution involves processing each character in the input string to determine if it should be replaced based on the specified conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires swapping the roles of whitespace characters and underscores in the input string. Specifically:\n   - Every whitespace character (as defined by Rust's `is_whitespace` method) should be replaced with an underscore (`'_'`).\n   - Every underscore (`'_'`) should be replaced with a space (`' '`).\n   - All other characters remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each character in the input string, we can check if the character is a whitespace or an underscore.
