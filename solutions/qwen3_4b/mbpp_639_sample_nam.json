The solution involves filtering out names that start with lowercase letters and then summing the lengths of the remaining names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Filter Names**: Iterate over each name in the input vector and filter out names that start with a lowercase letter. This includes:\n   - Names that are empty (they don't start with any letter).\n   - Names that start with an uppercase letter or a non-letter character.\n2. **Sum Lengths**: For each name that passes the filter, convert its length (number of characters) to an `isize` and add it to the cumulative sum.\n\nThe key insight here is to efficiently check if a name starts with a lowercase letter using Rust's standard library functions. We use:\n- `s.is_empty()` to handle empty strings.\n- `s.chars().next().unwrap().is_ascii_lowercase()` to check if the first character of a non-empty string is a lowercase ASCII letter.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn sample_nam(sample_names: Vec<String>) -> isize {\n    sample_names\n        .into_iter()\n        .filter(|s| s.is_empty() || !s.chars().next().unwrap().is_ascii_lowercase())\n        .map(|s| s.len() as isize)\n        .sum()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Filtering Names**: The `filter` method is used to keep only those names that do **not** start with a lowercase letter. \n   - For empty strings (`s.is_empty()`), they are included since they don't start with any letter.\n   - For non-empty strings, we check if the first character (`s.chars().next().unwrap()`) is not a lowercase ASCII letter using `is_ascii_lowercase()`.\n2. **Mapping and Summing**: The `map` method converts the length of each valid name (as a `usize`) to `isize` to match the return type. The `sum` method then computes the total length of all filtered names.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input vector in a single pass, leveraging Rust's iterator methods for concise and readable code. The solution handles edge cases like empty strings and non-letter starting characters correctly. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of names in the input vector, as each name is processed exactly once.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the lengths of all names in a given vector that do not start with a lowercase letter. The solution involves iterating through each name in the vector, checking if it starts with a lowercase letter, and only including names that start with an uppercase letter or a non-letter character in the sum.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with a total sum initialized to 0.\n2. **Iterate through names**: For each name in the vector:\n   - **Check for empty string**: If the name is empty, skip the check and add its length (0) to the total.\n   - **Check first character**: If the name is not empty, get the first character of the name.\n   - **Check if lowercase**: If the first character is a lowercase letter, skip this name.\n   - **Add length**: Otherwise, add the length of the name to the total.\n3. **Return total**: After processing all names, return the total sum as an `isize`.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each name exactly once, making it optimal with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of names in the vector.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn sample_nam(sample_names: Vec<String>) -> isize {\n    let mut total = 0;\n    for name in sample_names {\n        if !name.is_empty() {\n            let first_char = name.chars().next().unwrap();\n            if first_char.is_lowercase() {\n                continue;\n            }\n        }\n        total += name.len() as isize;\n    }\n    total\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The variable `total` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of lengths of valid names.\n- **Processing each name**:\n  - **Empty string check**: If a name is empty (`name.is_empty()` returns `true`), it is processed by adding 0 to `total` (since the length of an empty string is 0).\n  - **First character check**: For non-empty names, the first character is checked. If it is a lowercase letter (`first_char.is_lowercase()` returns `true`), the name is skipped.\n  - **Length addition**: Names that do not start with a lowercase letter (including those starting with uppercase letters or non-letter characters) have their lengths added to `total`.\n- **Result**: After processing all names, `total` holds the sum of lengths of all names that meet the criteria (not starting with a lowercase letter), which is returned as an `isize`.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all edge cases, including empty strings and names starting with non-letter characters, ensuring correctness for any input vector of names. The approach is both time and space efficient, operating in linear time relative to the number of names.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to sum the lengths of the names in a given vector after removing all names that start with a lowercase letter.

Names that are empty or start with a non-lowercase character (like uppercase letters, digits, or symbols) are retained.\n2. **Sum Lengths**: For each retained name, compute its length (number of characters) and accumulate the sum as an `isize`.\n\nThe key insight here is that a name should be included in the sum if:\n- It is empty (since it doesn't start with any letter), or\n- Its first character is not a lowercase letter.\n\nWe use Rust's iterator methods to efficiently handle the filtering and summing:\n- `into_iter()` converts the vector into an iterator for efficient processing.\n- `filter()` retains names that meet the condition (not starting with a lowercase letter).\n- `map()` converts each retained name's length to `isize`.\n- `sum()` accumulates the total length.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn sample_nam(sample_names: Vec<String>) -> isize {\n    sample_names.into_iter()\n        .filter(|s| s.chars().next().map_or(true, |c| !c.is_ascii_lowercase()))\n        .map(|s| s.len() as isize)\n        .sum()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Filtering Names**: The `filter` method checks each name `s` in the vector. For each name:\n   - If the name is empty (`s.chars().next()` returns `None`), the condition evaluates to `true` (since `map_or(true, ...)` returns `true` for `None`).\n   - If the name is non-empty, it checks the first character `c` to see if it is not a lowercase letter (`!c.is_ascii_lowercase()`). If true, the name is retained.\n2. **Mapping and Summing**: The `map` method converts each retained name's length (a `usize`) to `isize`. The `sum` method then adds up all these lengths to produce the final result.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each name exactly once, making it optimal with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of names in the input vector.
