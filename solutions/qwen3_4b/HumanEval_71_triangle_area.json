If the sides do not form a valid triangle, we return `-1.0`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Positive Sides**: The triangle must have all positive side lengths. If any side is zero or negative, it's invalid.\n2. **Check Triangle Inequalities**: For three sides to form a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third side. If any of these conditions fail, the sides do not form a valid triangle.\n3. **Calculate Area Using Heron's Formula**: If the sides form a valid triangle, compute the area using Heron's formula:\n   - First, calculate the semi-perimeter $ s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} $.\n   - Then, the area is $ \\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} $.\n4. **Round to Two Decimal Places**: The computed area is rounded to two decimal places using standard rounding techniques.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn triangle_area(a: isize, b: isize, c: isize) -> f64 {\n    if a <= 0 || b <= 0 || c <= 0 {\n        return -1.0;\n    }\n\n    if a + b <= c || a + c <= b || b + c <= a {\n        return -1.0;\n    }\n\n    let s = (a as f64 + b as f64 + c as f64) / 2.0;\n    let area = (s * (s - a as f64) * (s - b as f64) * (s - c as f64)).sqrt();\n    (area * 100.0).round() / 100.0\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Positive Sides Check**: The code first checks if any of the sides (`a`, `b`, `c`) is non-positive. If so, it immediately returns `-1.0`.\n2. **Triangle Inequality Check**: The code verifies that the sum of every pair of sides is strictly greater than the third side. If any of these conditions fail (i.e., `a + b <= c`, `a + c <= b`, or `b + c <= a`), it returns `-1.0`.\n3. **Heron's Formula Calculation**: The semi-perimeter `s` is calculated as the average of the three sides. The area is then computed using the formula $ \\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} $.\n4. **Rounding**: The computed area is multiplied by 100, rounded to the nearest integer, and then divided by 100 to round it to two decimal places. This ensures the result is formatted correctly as required.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for valid triangle conditions and computes the area with the required precision, providing a clear and correct solution to the problem.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if three given side lengths form a valid triangle. If they do, we calculate the area of the triangle rounded to two decimal places; otherwise, we return -1.0.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Triangle Validity**: For three sides to form a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third side. This means:\n   - \\(a + b > c\\)\n   - \\(a + c > b\\)\n   - \\(b + c > a\\)\n   If any of these conditions fail, the sides do not form a valid triangle, and we return -1.0.\n\n2. **Calculate Area Using Heron's Formula**: If the sides form a valid triangle, we compute the area using Heron's formula:\n   - First, calculate the semi-perimeter \\(s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2}\\).\n   - Then, the area is given by \\(\\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}\\).\n\n3. **Round to Two Decimal Places**: The computed area is rounded to two decimal places. This is done by multiplying the area by 100, rounding to the nearest integer, and then dividing by 100.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn triangle_area(a: isize, b: isize, c: isize) -> f64 {\n    let a = a as f64;\n    let b = b as f64;\n    let c = c as f64;\n\n    if a + b <= c || a + c <= b || b + c <= a {\n        return -1.0;\n    }\n\n    let s = (a + b + c) / 2.0;\n    let area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)).sqrt();\n\n    (area * 100.0).round() / 100.0\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Conversion**: The input side lengths (as `isize`) are converted to `f64` for precise floating-point calculations.\n2. **Triangle Validity Check**: The code checks if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If not, it returns -1.0 immediately.\n3. **Semi-Perimeter Calculation**: The semi-perimeter \\(s\\) is calculated as \\((a + b + c) / 2\\).\n4. **Area Calculation**: Using Heron's formula, the area is computed as \\(\\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}\\).\n5. **Rounding**: The area is rounded to two decimal places by multiplying by 100, rounding to the nearest integer, and then dividing by 100.
