Specifically, lowercase characters should be converted to uppercase, and uppercase characters should be converted to lowercase. Non-alphabetic characters should remain unchanged.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iterate over each character** in the input string using the `chars()` method, which returns an iterator over each character in the string.\n2. **Check the case of each character**:\n   - If the character is uppercase, convert it to lowercase using `to_lowercase()`.\n   - If the character is lowercase, convert it to uppercase using `to_uppercase()`.\n   - If the character is not alphabetic, leave it unchanged.\n3. **Collect the results** into a new string by processing each character through the above checks and conversions.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each character in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the string. The solution leverages Rust's standard library methods for case conversion and ensures correct handling of all character types.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn flip_case(string: String) -> String {\n    string.chars()\n        .map(|c| {\n            if c.is_uppercase() {\n                c.to_lowercase().chars().next().unwrap()\n            } else if c.is_lowercase() {\n                c.to_uppercase().chars().next().unwrap()\n            } else {\n                c\n            }\n        })\n        .collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Iteration**: The `string.chars()` method splits the input string into an iterator of individual characters.\n2. **Case Conversion**:\n   - For each uppercase character (`c.is_uppercase()`), `c.to_lowercase()` converts it to lowercase. The result is a `String` of length 1, so we take the first character with `chars().next().unwrap()`.\n   - For each lowercase character (`c.is_lowercase()`), `c.to_uppercase()` converts it to uppercase. Similarly, we extract the first character from the resulting `String`.\n   - Non-alphabetic characters are directly included in the result without any modification.\n3. **Result Construction**: The processed characters are collected into a new `String` using the `collect()` method, which efficiently builds the output string.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the case flipping for all characters in the input string while maintaining the original order of characters. The approach ensures optimal performance with minimal overhead, leveraging Rust's standard library for robust and readable code.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to flip the case of each character in a given string. Specifically, lowercase characters should be converted to uppercase, and uppercase characters should be converted to lowercase. Non-alphabet characters should remain unchanged. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves processing each character in the input string. For each character:\n   - If it is an ASCII lowercase letter, convert it to an ASCII uppercase letter.\n   - If it is an ASCII uppercase letter, convert it to an ASCII lowercase letter.\n   - If it is any other character (non-alphabet), leave it unchanged.\n   \n2. **Key Insight**: The problem specifies that the input string is likely to be in ASCII (as seen in the example \"Hello\"), so we use ASCII-specific methods for case conversion. This ensures efficiency and correctness for the given context.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Iterate over each character in the input string.\n   - For each character, check if it is an ASCII lowercase letter using `is_ascii_lowercase()`.\n   - If true, convert it to uppercase using `to_ascii_uppercase()`.\n   - If it is an ASCII uppercase letter (using `is_ascii_uppercase()`), convert it to lowercase using `to_ascii_lowercase()`.\n   - Otherwise, keep the character as it is.\n   - Collect all processed characters into a new string.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character in the string exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the resulting string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn flip_case(string: String) -> String {\n    string.chars().map(|c| {\n        if c.is_ascii_lowercase() {\n            c.to_ascii_uppercase()\n        } else if c.is_ascii_uppercase() {\n            c.to_ascii_lowercase()\n        } else {\n            c\n        }\n    }).collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The function takes a `String` as input.\n- **Character Processing**: For each character in the string:\n  - If the character is an ASCII lowercase letter (e.g., 'a' to 'z'), it is converted to uppercase (e.g., 'A' to 'Z') using `to_ascii_uppercase()`.\n  - If the character is an ASCII uppercase letter (e.g., 'A' to 'Z'), it is converted to lowercase (e.g., 'a' to 'z') using `to_ascii_lowercase()`.\n  - Non-alphabet characters (e.g., digits, symbols) are left unchanged.\n- **Result Construction**: The processed characters are collected into a new `String` using `collect()`, which efficiently builds the result from the iterator.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the case flipping for ASCII characters while leaving non-alphabet characters intact, meeting the problem requirements with optimal performance.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to flip the case of each character in a given string.
