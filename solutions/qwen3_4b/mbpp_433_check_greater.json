The solution involves checking each element in the vector to ensure the number is strictly greater than all of them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to verify that the input number is greater than every element in the provided vector. This means for each element `x` in the vector, the condition `number > x` must hold true.\n2. **Intuition**: We can iterate through each element in the vector and check if the number is greater than the current element. If any element fails this condition, we immediately return `false`. If all elements satisfy the condition, we return `true`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Using Rust's standard library, we can leverage the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector elements. The `all()` method on this iterator checks if all elements meet the condition specified in a closure. This approach is efficient as it breaks early upon finding any element that does not satisfy the condition.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the vector. In the worst case (when all elements are smaller), we check every element once. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of additional space.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn check_greater(arr: Vec<isize>, number: isize) -> bool {\n    arr.iter().all(|x| number > *x)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Signature**: The function `check_greater` takes a vector of `isize` values (`arr`) and a single `isize` value (`number`) as parameters.\n- **Iterator and Check**: The `arr.iter()` method returns an iterator over the elements of the vector. The `all()` method is then used to check if every element `x` in the iterator satisfies the condition `number > *x` (where `*x` dereferences the reference `x` to get the actual integer value).\n- **Early Termination**: If any element in the vector is not less than `number`, `all()` returns `false` immediately without checking further elements, optimizing the solution.\n- **Edge Cases**: \n  - If the vector is empty, `all()` returns `true` (vacuously true), which is correct since the number is trivially greater than all elements (there are none).\n  - The solution handles all integer values correctly, including negative numbers and large values.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the condition with minimal overhead, leveraging Rust's standard library for concise and readable code.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number is strictly greater than every element in a vector of integers.

The `all` method checks if all elements in the iterator satisfy a given condition.
