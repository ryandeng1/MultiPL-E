The resulting vector should be sorted in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves checking each number in the input vector to determine if all its digits are odd. If a number meets this criterion, it is included in the result vector. The result vector must then be sorted in ascending order.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each number, we process its digits from least significant to most significant. If any digit is even, the number is excluded from the result.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Digit Check**: For each number, repeatedly extract the last digit (using modulo 10) and check if it is even. If any digit is even, the number is discarded.\n   - **Filtering**: Collect numbers that pass the digit check into a result vector.\n   - **Sorting**: Sort the result vector in ascending order to meet the output requirement.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: O(N * D), where N is the number of elements in the input vector and D is the average number of digits per element. This is because each number is processed digit by digit.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the result vector.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn unique_digits(x: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    let has_even = |n: isize| -> bool {\n        let mut n = n;\n        while n > 0 {\n            let digit = n % 10;\n            if digit % 2 == 0 {\n                return true;\n            }\n            n /= 10;\n        }\n        false\n    };\n    let mut result = Vec::new();\n    for num in x {\n        if !has_even(num) {\n            result.push(num);\n        }\n    }\n    result.sort();\n    result\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Digit Check**: The closure `has_even` checks if a number contains any even digits. It does this by repeatedly extracting the last digit (using `n % 10`), checking if it is even (`digit % 2 == 0`), and then removing the last digit (using integer division `n /= 10`).\n2. **Filtering**: The main function iterates over each number in the input vector. If `has_even` returns `false` (indicating all digits are odd), the number is added to the result vector.\n3. **Sorting**: After processing all numbers, the result vector is sorted in ascending order using `result.sort()`, ensuring the output meets the specified requirement.\n\nThis approach efficiently filters and sorts the numbers as required, leveraging simple digit manipulation and standard sorting to achieve the solution.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to filter a vector of positive integers to include only those numbers that have **no even digits**. The resulting vector should be sorted in **increasing order**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Problem Analysis\n\n- **Input**: A vector of `isize` (positive integers).\n- **Output**: A sorted vector of `isize` where each number has **all digits odd** (i.e., no even digits).\n- **Key Insight**: For each number, we check if all its digits are odd. If so, it's included in the result.\n- **Sorting Requirement**: The final result must be sorted in **increasing order**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Approach\n\n1. **Iterate through each number** in the input vector.\n2. **Check each digit** of the number:\n   - Extract the last digit using `n % 10`.\n   - If the digit is even (`digit % 2 == 0`), mark the number as invalid and skip further checks.\n   - Continue processing the next digit by updating `n = n / 10`.\n3. **Collect valid numbers** (those with all odd digits) into a new vector.\n4. **Sort the resulting vector** in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each number for even digits without converting the number to a string, which is both time and memory efficient.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Implementation\n\nHere's the Rust implementation:\n\n```rust\nfn unique_digits(x: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    let mut result: Vec<isize> = Vec::new();\n    for num in x {\n        let mut n = num;\n        let mut has_even = false;\n        while n > 0 {\n            let digit = n % 10;\n            if digit % 2 == 0 {\n                has_even = true;\n                break;\n            }\n            n /= 10;\n        }\n        if !has_even {\n            result.push(num);\n        }\n    }\n    result.sort();\n    result\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Explanation\n\n- **Loop through each number**: We process each number in the input vector.\n- **Digit check**: For each number, we repeatedly extract the last digit using modulo 10 and check if it's even.\n- **Early termination**: If any even digit is found, we stop checking further digits for that number.\n- **Filtering**: Only numbers with all odd digits are added to the result vector.\n- **Sorting**: The result vector is sorted in increasing order using Rust\u2019s built-in `sort()` method.\n\nThis solution is optimal for the given constraints and handles all edge cases correctly.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Example Walkthrough\n\nGiven:\n```rust\nunique_digits(vec![15, 33, 1422, 1])\n```\n\n- **15**: Digits `1` and `5` \u2192 both odd \u2192 included\n- **33**: Digits `3` and `3` \u2192 both odd \u2192 included\n- **1422**: Contains `4` and `2` \u2192 even \u2192 excluded\n- **1**: Digit `1` \u2192 odd \u2192 included\n\nResulting vector after sorting: `[1, 15, 33]`\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Final Answer\n\n```rust\nfn unique_digits(x: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    let mut result: Vec<isize> = Vec::new();\n    for num in x {\n        let mut n = num;\n        let mut has_even = false;\n        while n > 0 {\n            let digit = n % 10;\n            if digit % 2 == 0 {\n                has_even = true;\n                break;\n            }\n            n /= 10;\n        }\n        if !has_even {\n            result.push(num);\n        }\n    }\n    result.sort();\n    result\n}\n```", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to filter out all elements from a given vector of positive integers that do not contain any even digits. The resulting vector should be sorted in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves checking each number in the input vector to determine if all its digits are odd. If a number has any even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is excluded from the result. The remaining numbers are collected into a new vector, which is then sorted in ascending order.\n2. **Intuition**: For each number in the input vector, convert it to a string to process each digit individually. Check each digit to see if it is even. If any digit is even, the number is skipped; otherwise, it is added to the result vector.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Iterate through each number in the input vector.\n   - Convert each number to a string to facilitate digit-by-digit processing.\n   - For each character in the string (representing a digit), convert it to an integer and check if it is even.\n   - If no even digits are found, add the number to the result vector.\n   - Sort the result vector in ascending order.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where `n` is the number of elements in the input vector and `m` is the average number of digits per element. Converting each number to a string and checking each digit contributes to this complexity.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the result vector.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn unique_digits(x: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    let mut result = Vec::new();\n    for num in x {\n        let s = num.to_string();\n        let mut has_even = false;\n        for c in s.chars() {\n            let digit = c.to_digit(10).unwrap();\n            if digit % 2 == 0 {\n                has_even = true;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if !has_even {\n            result.push(num);\n        }\n    }\n    result.sort();\n    result\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: An empty vector `result` is initialized to store numbers that meet the criteria.\n2. **Processing Each Number**: For each number in the input vector:\n   - Convert the number to a string to process each digit individually.\n   - Iterate over each character in the string (each digit).\n   - Convert each character to its numeric value and check if it is even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder).\n   - If any digit is even, mark `has_even` as `true` and break out of the loop early for efficiency.\n3. **Collecting Valid Numbers**: If no even digits are found (`has_even` remains `false`), the number is added to `result`.\n4. **Sorting**: The `result` vector is sorted in ascending order using Rust's built-in `sort` method.\n5. **Return Result**: The sorted `result` vector is returned, which contains all numbers from the input that have no even digits.\n\nThis approach efficiently filters and sorts the numbers as required, ensuring correctness and optimal performance for the given problem constraints."]}
