The solution involves parsing a string that contains the counts of apples and oranges, then computing the remaining fruits (mangoes) by subtracting the known counts from the total.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse the Input String**: The input string is structured as `\"X apples and Y oranges\"`, where `X` and `Y` are integers representing the counts of apples and oranges, respectively.\n2. **Split the String**: Split the string into parts using whitespace as the delimiter. This will yield a list of strings where the first element is the count of apples and the fourth element is the count of oranges.\n3. **Convert to Integers**: Convert the extracted string parts (the counts of apples and oranges) into integers.\n4. **Compute Mangoes**: Subtract the counts of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits (`n`) to get the number of mangoes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn fruit_distribution(s: String, n: isize) -> isize {\n    let parts: Vec<&str> = s.split(' ').collect();\n    let apples = parts[0].parse::<isize>().unwrap();\n    let oranges = parts[3].parse::<isize>().unwrap();\n    n - apples - oranges\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **String Splitting**: The input string `s` is split into a vector of substrings using the `split(' ')` method. For example, the string `\"5 apples and 6 oranges\"` is split into `[\"5\", \"apples\", \"and\", \"6\", \"oranges\"]`.\n2. **Extracting Counts**: The first element (`parts[0]`) of the vector is the count of apples, and the fourth element (`parts[3]`) is the count of oranges.\n3. **Conversion to Integers**: These string elements are converted into integers using Rust's `parse` method. The `unwrap` method is used here because the problem guarantees the input string is correctly formatted.\n4. **Calculation**: The number of mangoes is computed by subtracting the counts of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits (`n`). For instance, if `n` is 19 and the counts are 5 apples and 6 oranges, the result is `19 - 5 - 6 = 8`.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages string manipulation and arithmetic operations to solve the problem with minimal computational overhead, ensuring correctness for all valid inputs as specified.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of mango fruits in a basket given the total number of fruits and the count of apples and oranges. The input is a string describing the number of apples and oranges, and an integer representing the total number of fruits in the basket.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse the Input String**: The input string follows a specific format: `[number] apples and [number] oranges`. For example, `\"5 apples and 6 oranges\"`.\n2. **Split the String**: By splitting the string using spaces, we can extract the relevant parts. The split will result in a list of tokens where:\n   - The first token is the number of apples.\n   - The third token is `\"and\"`.\n   - The fourth token is the number of oranges.\n3. **Convert Tokens to Integers**: Convert the first and fourth tokens (which represent the counts of apples and oranges) from strings to integers.\n4. **Calculate Mango Count**: Subtract the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn fruit_distribution(s: String, n: isize) -> isize {\n    let tokens: Vec<&str> = s.split(' ').collect();\n    let apples = tokens[0].parse::<isize>().unwrap();\n    let oranges = tokens[3].parse::<isize>().unwrap();\n    n - apples - oranges\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Splitting the String**: The input string is split into tokens using the space character as a delimiter. For example, the string `\"5 apples and 6 oranges\"` becomes the token list `[\"5\", \"apples\", \"and\", \"6\", \"oranges\"]`.\n2. **Extracting Values**: The first token (`tokens[0]`) is the count of apples, and the fourth token (`tokens[3]`) is the count of oranges.\n3. **Conversion and Calculation**: These tokens are converted from strings to integers. The number of mangoes is then calculated by subtracting the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits (`n`).\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the structured format of the input string to extract the necessary values with minimal processing, ensuring correctness and simplicity. The solution handles all specified edge cases and adheres to the problem constraints.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of mango fruits in a basket given the total number of fruits and a string that describes the count of apples and oranges.

This helps in isolating the numerical values for apples and oranges.\n2. **Extract Numerical Values**: The first token represents the number of apples, and the fourth token (index 3 in zero-based indexing) represents the number of oranges.\n3. **Convert Tokens to Integers**: Convert the extracted tokens into integers to perform arithmetic operations.\n4. **Compute Mango Count**: Subtract the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits (given as `n`) to get the count of mangoes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn fruit_distribution(s: String, n: isize) -> isize {\n    let tokens: Vec<&str> = s.split_whitespace().collect();\n    let apples = tokens[0].parse::<isize>().unwrap();\n    let oranges = tokens[3].parse::<isize>().unwrap();\n    n - apples - oranges\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Splitting the String**: The input string `s` is split into a vector of strings (`tokens`) using `split_whitespace()`, which handles any leading, trailing, or consecutive whitespace.\n2. **Extracting Values**: The first token (`tokens[0]`) is the count of apples, and the fourth token (`tokens[3]`) is the count of oranges. This is based on the consistent structure of the input string (e.g., \"5 apples and 6 oranges\" splits into `[\"5\", \"apples\", \"and\", \"6\", \"oranges\"]`).\n3. **Conversion and Calculation**: The extracted tokens are converted from strings to integers. The number of mangoes is then calculated as `n - apples - oranges`, where `n` is the total number of fruits in the basket.\n4. **Edge Handling**: The problem guarantees that the input string follows the specified format, so no additional validation is needed. The `unwrap()` method is used for parsing, assuming the input is correctly formatted as per the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently parses the input string, computes the required values, and delivers the solution in a straightforward and readable manner."]}
