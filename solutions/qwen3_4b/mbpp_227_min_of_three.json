The solution involves comparing each number to determine the smallest value. Here's the implementation:\n\n```rust\nfn min_of_three(a: isize, b: isize, c: isize) -> isize {\n    if a <= b && a <= c {\n        a\n    } else if b <= a && b <= c {\n        b\n    } else {\n        c\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \n1. **First Condition:** Checks if `a` is less than or equal to both `b` and `c`. If true, `a` is the smallest.\n2. **Second Condition:** Checks if `b` is less than or equal to both `a` and `c`. If true, `b` is the smallest.\n3. **Default Case:** If neither of the above conditions is met, `c` must be the smallest (since all numbers are compared in the conditions).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all cases, including when two or more numbers are equal (e.g., `a = 5`, `b = 5`, `c = 10` returns `5`).\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let result = min_of_three(10, 5, 7);\n    println!(\"{}\", result); // Output: 5\n}\n```\n\nThis solution is clear, concise, and works for any ` isize` values without relying on external libraries.", "\n\nTo find the minimum of three numbers, we can compare each number with the others using conditional statements. The approach involves checking if the first number is the smallest (i.e., less than or equal to both the second and third numbers). If not, we check if the second number is the smallest (i.e., less than or equal to the first and third numbers). If neither is the smallest, the third number is the minimum.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```rust\nfn min_of_three(a: isize, b: isize, c: isize) -> isize {\n    if a <= b && a <= c {\n        a\n    } else if b <= a && b <= c {\n        b\n    } else {\n        c\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. **First Condition (`a <= b && a <= c`)**: Checks if `a` is less than or equal to both `b` and `c`. If true, `a` is the minimum.\n2. **Second Condition (`b <= a && b <= c`)**: If `a` is not the minimum, checks if `b` is less than or equal to both `a` and `c`. If true, `b` is the minimum.\n3. **Else Clause**: If neither `a` nor `b` is the minimum, `c` must be the smallest.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all cases, including when multiple numbers are equal (it returns the first smallest encountered).\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let result = min_of_three(10, 20, 5);\n    println!(\"{}\", result); // Output: 5\n}\n```\n\nThis solution is clear, concise, and works for all valid input combinations of ` isize` values.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the minimum of three given numbers. The solution involves comparing the numbers step by step to determine the smallest value efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Compare the first two numbers**: Determine the smaller of the two numbers, `a` and `b`.\n2. **Compare the result with the third number**: Take the smaller of the first two numbers and compare it with the third number `c` to find the overall minimum.\n3. **Return the minimum**: The result of the comparison between the smaller of the first two numbers and the third number is the minimum of all three numbers.\n\nThis approach ensures that we only perform two comparisons, which is optimal for finding the minimum of three numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn min_of_three(a: isize, b: isize, c: isize) -> isize {\n    let min_ab = if a < b { a } else { b };\n    if min_ab < c {\n        min_ab\n    } else {\n        c\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Step 1**: The expression `let min_ab = if a < b { a } else { b }` compares `a` and `b` to find the smaller value. For example, if `a` is 5 and `b` is 3, `min_ab` will be 3.\n2. **Step 2**: The next comparison checks if `min_ab` (the smaller of `a` and `b`) is less than `c`. If true, `min_ab` is the minimum of all three numbers. Otherwise, `c` is the minimum.\n3. **Step 3**: The result of this comparison is returned. For instance, if `min_ab` is 3 and `c` is 4, the function returns 3. If `min_ab` is 3 and `c` is 2, the function returns 2.\n\nThis method efficiently narrows down the problem to two comparisons, ensuring optimal performance and correctness for all possible input values. The solution handles ties correctly by returning the smallest value encountered during the comparisons."]}
