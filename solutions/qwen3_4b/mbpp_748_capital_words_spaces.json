The key insight is that we should add a space before each capital letter that is not the first character of the string. This ensures that words starting with capital letters are properly separated by spaces.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires processing a string to insert spaces before every capital letter (A-Z) that is not the first character. For example, the string \"HelloWorld\" should become \"Hello World\".\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each character in the string, we can check if the current character is a capital letter. If it is and it's not the first character, we add a space followed by the capital letter to the result string.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a fold operation to process each character in the string. The fold starts with an empty string and builds the result incrementally:\n   - For the first character, we simply add it to the result.\n   - For subsequent characters, if the character is uppercase, we add a space followed by the character to the result.\n   - Otherwise, we add the character directly to the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn capital_words_spaces(str1: String) -> String {\n    str1.chars().fold(String::new(), |acc, c| {\n        if acc.is_empty() {\n            acc.push(c);\n        } else if c.is_uppercase() {\n            acc.push(' ');\n            acc.push(c);\n        } else {\n            acc.push(c);\n        }\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The function starts with an empty string (`acc`) to build the result.\n- **Processing Characters**:\n  - **First Character**: The first character is added directly to the result without any space.\n  - **Subsequent Characters**: For each subsequent character:\n    - If the character is uppercase, a space is added before the character to the result.\n    - If the character is not uppercase, it is added directly to the result.\n- **Result Construction**: The fold operation efficiently builds the result string by processing each character in sequence, ensuring spaces are inserted only before capital letters that are not the first character of the string.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and straightforward, meeting the problem's requirements by correctly inserting spaces between words that start with capital letters.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to insert spaces between words in a given string that start with capital letters. The key insight is that we should add a space before each capital letter that is not the first character in the string and is not preceded by another capital letter. This ensures that we only add spaces between distinct words starting with capital letters, without adding extra spaces at the beginning or between consecutive capital letters (like in acronyms).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty string to build the result.\n2. **Iterate through each character** in the input string:\n   - **First character**: Directly add it to the result without any checks.\n   - **Subsequent characters**:\n     - If the current character is uppercase:\n       - Check if the previous character is not uppercase. If so, add a space before the current character.\n       - Then add the current character to the result.\n     - If the current character is not uppercase, simply add it to the result.\n3. **Return the result**: After processing all characters, return the constructed string with spaces inserted as needed.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each character in linear time, making it optimal for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn capital_words_spaces(str1: String) -> String {\n    let mut result = String::new();\n    for i in 0..str1.len() {\n        let c = str1.chars().nth(i).unwrap();\n        if i == 0 {\n            result.push(c);\n        } else {\n            if c.is_uppercase() {\n                if !str1.chars().nth(i - 1).unwrap().is_uppercase() {\n                    result.push(' ');\n                }\n                result.push(c);\n            } else {\n                result.push(c);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    result\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The `result` string starts empty to accumulate the output.\n- **Character Processing**:\n  - For the first character (`i = 0`), it is directly added to `result` without any checks.\n  - For each subsequent character (`i > 0`):\n    - If the character is uppercase, we check if the previous character is not uppercase. If true, a space is added before the current character.\n    - The current character is then added to `result`.\n    - If the character is not uppercase, it is added directly to `result`.\n- **Result Construction**: The loop processes each character exactly once, building `result` with spaces inserted only where necessary (before each uppercase letter that starts a new word).\n\nThis method ensures that words starting with capital letters are properly separated by spaces without introducing extra spaces or breaking acronyms (e.g., \"USA\" remains \"USA\" instead of \"U S A\"). The solution efficiently handles all edge cases, including empty strings and single-character inputs, by processing each character in a single pass through the input string. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, making it optimal for large inputs.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to insert spaces between words in a given string where each word starts with a capital letter. The key insight is that we should only add a space before a capital letter that is not the first character of the string. This approach ensures that the first word (which starts with a capital letter) does not get an extra space at the beginning.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Empty String**: If the input string is empty, return it as is.\n2. **Initialize Result String**: Start building the result string by adding the first character of the input string (since it's the start of the first word and should not have a preceding space).\n3. **Process Subsequent Characters**: For each subsequent character in the input string:\n   - If the character is a capital letter (i.e., between 'A' and 'Z' in ASCII), prepend a space to the result string before adding this character.\n   - Otherwise, simply add the character to the result string.\n4. **Return Result**: After processing all characters, return the constructed result string.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each character in the string exactly once, resulting in an O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the input string.

If so, it returns the string immediately.\n2. **First Character Handling**: The first character of the input string is added to the result string without any preceding space, as it starts the first word.\n3. **Character Processing Loop**: For each subsequent character in the string:\n   - **Capital Letter Check**: If the character is uppercase (using `is_uppercase`), a space is added to the result string before appending the character.\n   - **Non-Capital Character**: If the character is not uppercase, it is directly appended to the result string.\n4. **Result Construction**: The loop processes each character in linear time, building the result string with spaces inserted before every uppercase letter (except the first character).\n\nThis solution efficiently transforms the input string by inserting spaces between words that start with capital letters, meeting the problem requirements without unnecessary overhead. The approach ensures clarity and correctness for the specified problem constraints."]}
