The function should process the words in the order they appear in the string `s`. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Split the Input String**: The input string `s` is split into individual words using the space character as the delimiter. This gives us a list of words.\n2. **Filter Empty Words**: Since the problem specifies that the input string contains only letters and spaces, we filter out any empty strings that might result from leading, trailing, or consecutive spaces.\n3. **Count Consonants in Each Word**: For each word, we count the number of consonants. A consonant is defined as any letter that is not a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), regardless of case.\n4. **Check and Collect Words**: For each word, if the count of consonants matches the given number `n`, the word is added to the result vector.\n5. **Return Result**: The result vector, containing all qualifying words in their original order, is returned.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn select_words(s: String, n: isize) -> Vec<String> {\n    let words: Vec<&str> = s.split(' ').filter(|w| !w.is_empty()).collect();\n    let mut result = Vec::new();\n    for word in words {\n        let mut count = 0;\n        for c in word.chars() {\n            let lower_c = c.to_lowercase().chars().next().unwrap();\n            if lower_c != 'a' && lower_c != 'e' && lower_c != 'i' && lower_c != 'o' && lower_c != 'u' {\n                count += 1;\n            }\n        }\n        if count as isize == n {\n            result.push(word.to_string());\n        }\n    }\n    result\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Splitting the String**: The string `s` is split into a vector of substrings using `split(' ')`, which separates the string at each space. This gives us all the words in the string.\n2. **Filtering Empty Words**: The `filter` method is used to exclude any empty strings from the split result, ensuring we only process actual words.\n3. **Counting Consonants**: For each character in a word:\n   - Convert the character to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.\n   - Check if the lowercase character is not one of the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). If it's not a vowel, it's counted as a consonant.\n4. **Checking and Collecting**: After counting consonants in a word, if the count matches the input `n`, the word is converted to a `String` and added to the result vector.\n5. **Result Handling**: The result vector, which contains all words meeting the consonant count requirement, is returned. If no words meet the criteria, an empty vector is returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each word in the input string, counts consonants while handling case insensitivity, and collects the qualifying words in their original order. The solution handles edge cases such as empty input strings and ensures optimal performance by processing each character only once.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement a function that returns all words from a given string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants.

We filter out any empty strings that might result from consecutive spaces.\n2. **Count Consonants**: For each word, we count the number of consonants. A consonant is defined as a letter that is not a vowel (case-insensitive). Vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'.\n3. **Check Consonant Count**: For each word, if the count of consonants matches the given `n`, the word is added to the result vector.\n4. **Return Result**: The function returns the result vector containing all words that meet the criteria.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn select_words(s: String, n: isize) -> Vec<String> {\n    let mut result = Vec::new();\n    for word in s.split(' ').filter(|w| !w.is_empty()) {\n        let count = word.chars().filter(|c| {\n            let c_lower = c.to_lowercase().next().unwrap();\n            c_lower != 'a' && c_lower != 'e' && c_lower != 'i' && c_lower != 'o' && c_lower != 'u'\n        }).count();\n        if count as isize == n {\n            result.push(word.to_string());\n        }\n    }\n    result\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Splitting the String**: The string `s` is split into a list of words using `s.split(' ')`. This method splits the string at each space character. The `filter` method ensures that only non-empty words are processed.\n2. **Counting Consonants**: For each word, we iterate over each character. Each character is converted to lowercase to handle case insensitivity. We then check if the character is not a vowel (i.e., not 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'). The count of such characters gives the number of consonants in the word.\n3. **Matching Consonant Count**: If the count of consonants in a word equals the given `n`, the word is added to the result vector.\n4. **Result Construction**: The result vector is built incrementally as each qualifying word is processed. If the input string is empty, the result vector remains empty.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each word in the input string, checks for the required number of consonants, and constructs the result vector in the correct order. The solution handles case insensitivity and ensures only valid words (non-empty) are considered. The complexity is linear with respect to the length of the input string, making it optimal for the problem constraints.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to implement a function that returns all words from a given string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants.

If it is not a vowel, it is counted as a consonant.\n4. **Checking Consonant Count**: The count of consonants for each word is compared with `n`. If they match, the word is added to the result vector as a `String`.\n5. **Result Compilation**: The result vector, which contains all words meeting the consonant count condition in the order they appeared in the input string, is returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each word in the input string, checks for the required consonant count, and compiles the result while handling edge cases like empty strings and case insensitivity. The solution is both optimal and straightforward, leveraging Rust's string and iterator capabilities for clarity and performance."]}
