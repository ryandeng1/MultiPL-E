Rust provides a built-in format specifier `{:b}` which directly converts an integer into its binary string format without any prefix or suffix.\n2. **Wrap with 'db'**: Once the binary string is obtained, we prepend and append the string \"db\" to form the final result as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe solution leverages Rust's formatting capabilities to efficiently handle the conversion and wrapping steps. This approach ensures that the binary string is correctly formatted and the required 'db' prefixes and suffixes are added without additional complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn decimal_to_binary(decimal: isize) -> String {\n    format!(\"db{:b}db\", decimal)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Format String**: The `format!` macro is used with the format string `\"db{:b}db\"`. The `{:b}` is a format specifier that converts the `decimal` value into its binary string representation.\n2. **Result Construction**: The binary string is placed between \"db\" at the start and \"db\" at the end. For example:\n   - If `decimal` is 15, the binary string is `\"1111\"`, so the result becomes `\"db1111db\"`.\n   - If `decimal` is 32, the binary string is `\"100000\"`, so the result becomes `\"db100000db\"`.\n\nThis approach efficiently meets the problem's requirements by utilizing Rust's built-in formatting to handle the conversion and wrapping steps in a concise and readable manner. The solution assumes non-negative inputs as the problem examples and context suggest this constraint.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given decimal number (as an `isize`) into its binary representation and then wrap it with the characters `'d'` and `'b'` at the beginning and end of the string, respectively. The key insight here is that Rust provides built-in functionality to convert integers to their binary string representations using the `format!` macro with the `{:b}` format specifier.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Decimal to Binary**: Use Rust's `format!` macro with the `{:b}` specifier to convert the integer `decimal` into its binary string representation. This specifier ensures that the binary string is generated without any leading zeros.\n2. **Wrap with 'db'**: Prepend the string `\"db\"` and append `\"db\"` to the binary string obtained in the previous step to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages Rust's built-in formatting capabilities to achieve the desired result with minimal code.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn decimal_to_binary(decimal: isize) -> String {\n    format!(\"db{:b}db\", decimal)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Binary Conversion**: The expression `format!(\"db{:b}db\", decimal)` uses the `{:b}` format specifier to convert the `decimal` value into its binary string representation. For example, if `decimal` is `15`, the binary string becomes `\"1111\"`.\n2. **String Wrapping**: The `format!` macro then wraps this binary string between `\"db\"` at the start and `\"db\"` at the end. Thus, the binary string `\"1111\"` becomes `\"db1111db\"`.\n\nThis solution efficiently meets the problem's requirements by utilizing Rust's built-in formatting to handle the conversion and wrapping steps in a concise and readable manner. The code handles all valid non-negative inputs correctly, as specified by the problem examples and constraints. \n\n**Note**: The problem specifies that the input is a decimal number, and the examples use positive integers. The solution assumes the input is non-negative to avoid issues with negative numbers (which would introduce a minus sign in the binary string). If negative inputs were to be handled, additional logic would be required, but the problem context implies non-negative inputs.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given decimal number (non-negative) into its binary representation as a string, with the prefix and suffix \"db\" added to the beginning and end of the binary string, respectively.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves converting a non-negative integer into its binary string representation. The key requirement is to prepend and append the string \"db\" to the binary string.\n2. **Insight**: Rust's `format!` macro provides a straightforward way to convert integers to their binary string representation using the `{:b}` format specifier.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Using Rust's built-in formatting capabilities, we can directly generate the binary string by specifying the format specifier `{:b}` within a string literal that includes the \"db\" prefixes and suffixes.\n4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles zero correctly (output \"db0db\") and ensures that all characters in the binary string are either '0' or '1' as required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn decimal_to_binary(decimal: isize) -> String {\n    format!(\"db{:b}db\", decimal)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Format Specifier**: The `{:b}` in the format string tells Rust to convert the `decimal` argument into its binary string representation.\n2. **String Construction**: The format string `\"db{:b}db\"` is used to construct the result. The `{}` placeholder is replaced by the binary string of `decimal`, and the resulting string is wrapped with \"db\" at both ends.\n3. **Example Handling**: \n   - For `decimal = 15`, the binary string is `\"1111\"`, so the output becomes `\"db1111db\"`.\n   - For `decimal = 32`, the binary string is `\"100000\"`, so the output becomes `\"db100000db\"`.\n4. **Edge Case Handling**: When `decimal = 0`, the binary string is `\"0\"`, resulting in `\"db0db\"`.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages Rust's string formatting capabilities to meet the problem's requirements with minimal code and optimal performance."]}
