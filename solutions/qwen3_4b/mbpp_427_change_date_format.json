The solution involves splitting the input string into its components (year, month, day), then reassembling them in the desired order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Split the Input String**: The input string is split into three parts using the hyphen (`-`) as the delimiter. The first part is the year, the second part is the month, and the third part is the day.\n2. **Reassemble the String**: The parts are then reassembled in the order: day, month, year, separated by hyphens to form the new date string in `dd-mm-yyyy` format.\n\nThe key insight here is that the input string is guaranteed to be in the `yyyy-mm-dd` format, so we can safely split it into exactly three parts. We use Rust's `split_once` method for efficient and clean splitting, which handles the hyphens without creating unnecessary intermediate vectors.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn change_date_format(dt: String) -> String {\n    let (year, rest) = dt.split_once('-').unwrap();\n    let (month, day) = rest.split_once('-').unwrap();\n    format!(\"{}-{}-{}\", day, month, year)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Splitting the String**: The `split_once` method is called on the input string `dt` to split it at the first hyphen. This gives us the year part (`year`) and the remaining string (`rest`).\n2. **Further Splitting**: The remaining string (`rest`) is then split at the next hyphen to separate the month (`month`) and day (`day`).\n3. **Reassembly**: The day, month, and year parts are formatted into a new string in the order `day-month-year` using `format!`, which produces the desired `dd-mm-yyyy` format.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages Rust's string splitting capabilities to convert the date format with minimal overhead and clear, readable code. The solution assumes the input string is always in the correct `yyyy-mm-dd` format as specified, so no additional error handling is necessary.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a date string from `yyyy-mm-dd` format to `dd-mm-yyyy` format. The input string is guaranteed to be in the correct format with exactly two hyphens separating the year, month, and day components.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Split the Input String**: The input string is split into three parts using the hyphen (`-`) as the delimiter. The first part is the year (4 digits), the second part is the month (2 digits), and the third part is the day (2 digits).\n2. **Reassemble the String**: The parts are then reassembled in the order: day, month, year, separated by hyphens to form the new date string in `dd-mm-yyyy` format.\n\nThe solution leverages Rust's string splitting capabilities to efficiently separate the components and recombine them in the desired order. The `split_once` method is used to split the string at the first hyphen for the year, then the remaining string is split again at the first hyphen to get the month and day.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn change_date_format(dt: String) -> String {\n    let (year, rest) = dt.split_once('-').unwrap();\n    let (month, day) = rest.split_once('-').unwrap();\n    format!(\"{}-{}-{}\", day, month, year)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Splitting the Year**: The input string `dt` is split into two parts at the first hyphen. The first part is the year (e.g., `\"2023\"`), and the remaining part is the rest of the string (e.g., `\"10-05\"`).\n2. **Splitting the Month and Day**: The remaining string is then split into two parts at the next hyphen. The first part is the month (e.g., `\"10\"`), and the second part is the day (e.g., `\"05\"`).\n3. **Reassembling the Result**: The day, month, and year parts are combined into a new string in the order `day-month-year` (e.g., `\"05-10-2023\"`), which is returned as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input string in two steps, ensuring the output is correctly formatted as `dd-mm-yyyy` without any additional validation or error handling, as the problem specifies the input is always in the correct format. The use of `split_once` ensures that only the first hyphen is considered, making the solution both concise and robust for the given problem constraints.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a date string from `yyyy-mm-dd` format to `dd-mm-yyyy` format. The input string is guaranteed to be in the correct `yyyy-mm-dd` format, meaning it will have exactly two hyphens separating four-digit years, two-digit months, and two-digit days.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Split the Input String**: The input string is split into three parts using the hyphen (`-`) as the delimiter. This results in a vector of three strings: the year (first part), the month (second part), and the day (third part).\n2. **Rearrange the Parts**: The parts are rearranged to form the new date string in the order `day-month-year`.\n3. **Construct the Output String**: The rearranged parts are combined into a new string with hyphens separating them, resulting in the `dd-mm-yyyy` format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn change_date_format(dt: String) -> String {\n    let parts: Vec<&str> = dt.split('-').collect();\n    format!(\"{}-{}-{}\", parts[2], parts[1], parts[0])\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Splitting the String**: The `dt.split('-')` method splits the input string into a `Split` iterator. The `collect()` method converts this iterator into a `Vec<&str>`, which contains the three parts of the date: year, month, and day.\n2. **Rearranging Parts**: The vector `parts` is indexed such that:\n   - `parts[0]` is the year (e.g., \"2023\")\n   - `parts[1]` is the month (e.g., \"10\")\n   - `parts[2]` is the day (e.g., \"05\")\n3. **Formatting the Output**: The `format!` macro constructs a new string by placing the day (`parts[2]`), month (`parts[1]`), and year (`parts[0]`) in the order `dd-mm-yyyy` (e.g., \"05-10-2023\").\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages Rust's string splitting and formatting capabilities to convert the date format as specified, assuming the input is always in the correct `yyyy-mm-dd` format. The solution is concise and handles the conversion in a single step without any additional error checking, as the problem guarantees the input format."]}
