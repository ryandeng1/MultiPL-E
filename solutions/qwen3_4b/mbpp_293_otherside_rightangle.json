The solution leverages the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the legs). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem specifies that we are given the lengths of two sides of a right-angled triangle and need to find the third side. The key insight here is that the problem assumes the two given sides are the legs of the triangle (the sides forming the right angle). Therefore, the third side we need to find is the hypotenuse.\n2. **Pythagorean Theorem**: According to the theorem, the hypotenuse \\( c \\) can be calculated as \\( c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the lengths of the legs.\n3. **Implementation**: Convert the input integer values (representing the legs) to floating-point numbers to ensure accurate computation. Compute the squares of both legs, sum them, and then take the square root of the result to get the hypotenuse.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn otherside_rightangle(w: isize, h: isize) -> f64 {\n    let w_f = w as f64;\n    let h_f = h as f64;\n    (w_f * w_f + h_f * h_f).sqrt()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Type Conversion**: The input parameters `w` and `h` are of type `isize` (signed integer). They are converted to `f64` (floating-point) to handle the arithmetic operations accurately.\n2. **Squaring and Summing**: The squares of the converted values (`w_f * w_f` and `h_f * h_f`) are computed and summed.\n3. **Square Root**: The square root of the sum is taken using the `.sqrt()` method, which gives the length of the hypotenuse.\n4. **Result**: The function returns the computed hypotenuse as a `f64` value.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem, ensuring correctness for the given problem constraints where the two input sides are the legs of the right-angled triangle. The solution handles the conversion and arithmetic operations in a straightforward manner, leveraging Rust's type system for clarity and precision.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the third side of a right-angled triangle when given the lengths of the two legs (width and height).
