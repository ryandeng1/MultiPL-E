A boredom is defined as a sentence that starts with the word \"I\". Sentences are delimited by '.', '?', or '!'. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Split the Input String into Sentences**: Iterate through each character of the input string. Whenever we encounter a sentence delimiter ('.', '?', or '!'), we split the current sentence (if it's not empty) into a separate sentence.\n2. **Process Each Sentence**: For each sentence:\n   - **Trim Whitespace**: Remove leading and trailing whitespace to handle cases where sentences might have extra spaces.\n   - **Check First Word**: Split the trimmed sentence into words and check if the first word is \"I\" (case-sensitive).\n3. **Count Valid Sentences**: Increment the count each time a sentence starts with the word \"I\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn is_bored(S: String) -> isize {\n    let mut count = 0;\n    let mut current = String::new();\n    for c in S.chars() {\n        if c == '.' || c == '?' || c == '!' {\n            if !current.is_empty() {\n                let sentence = current.trim();\n                let words: Vec<&str> = sentence.split_whitespace().collect();\n                if !words.is_empty() && words[0] == \"I\" {\n                    count += 1;\n                }\n                current.clear();\n            }\n        } else {\n            current.push(c);\n        }\n    }\n    if !current.is_empty() {\n        let sentence = current.trim();\n        let words: Vec<&str> = sentence.split_whitespace().collect();\n        if !words.is_empty() && words[0] == \"I\" {\n            count += 1;\n        }\n    }\n    count as isize\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with `count` set to 0 and `current` as an empty string to accumulate the current sentence.\n2. **Character Processing**: For each character in the input string:\n   - If the character is a sentence delimiter ('.', '?', or '!'), we process the current sentence (if it's not empty):\n     - **Trim the Sentence**: Remove leading and trailing whitespace.\n     - **Split into Words**: Split the trimmed sentence into a list of words.\n     - **Check First Word**: If the first word is \"I\", increment the count.\n     - **Clear Current Sentence**: Reset `current` for the next sentence.\n   - Otherwise, append the character to `current`.\n3. **Final Sentence Check**: After processing all characters, check if there's any remaining sentence in `current` and process it similarly.\n4. **Return Result**: Convert the count to `isize` and return it.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input string by splitting it into sentences at delimiters, checks each sentence for the required condition, and counts valid sentences. The solution handles edge cases such as leading/trailing whitespace and ensures case sensitivity for the word \"I\". \n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Each character is processed exactly once.\n**Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the current sentence and intermediate data structures.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of \"boredoms\" in a given string. A boredom is defined as a sentence that starts with the word \"I\" and is properly delimited by '.', '?', or '!'. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Split the String into Sentences**: Iterate through each character in the input string. Whenever we encounter a delimiter ('.', '?', or '!'), we consider the current sentence (if it's not empty) as a valid sentence and add it to our list of sentences. We reset the current sentence buffer after processing each delimiter.\n2. **Trim and Process Sentences**: For each sentence in our list, trim any leading or trailing whitespace. Split the trimmed sentence into words to check if the first word is \"I\".\n3. **Count Valid Boredoms**: Increment the count for each sentence that starts with the word \"I\" (case-sensitive).\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn is_bored(S: String) -> isize {\n    let mut sentences = Vec::new();\n    let mut current_sentence = String::new();\n\n    for c in S.chars() {\n        if c == '.' || c == '?' || c == '!' {\n            if !current_sentence.is_empty() {\n                sentences.push(current_sentence.clone());\n                current_sentence = String::new();\n            }\n        } else {\n            current_sentence.push(c);\n        }\n    }\n\n    let mut count = 0;\n    for s in sentences {\n        let trimmed = s.trim();\n        if !trimmed.is_empty() {\n            let words: Vec<&str> = trimmed.split_whitespace().collect();\n            if words.len() > 0 && words[0] == \"I\" {\n                count += 1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    count as isize\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Splitting Sentences**: The loop processes each character in the input string. When a delimiter ('.', '?', or '!') is encountered, the current sentence (if not empty) is added to the `sentences` list, and the buffer is reset.\n2. **Processing Sentences**: Each sentence in the `sentences` list is trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace. The trimmed sentence is then split into words.\n3. **Checking for Boredoms**: For each sentence, we check if the first word is exactly \"I\" (case-sensitive). If it is, we increment our count.\n4. **Returning the Result**: The final count is converted to an `isize` and returned as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input string by splitting it into valid sentences based on delimiters, checks each sentence for the required condition, and counts the valid \"boredoms\" accurately. The solution handles edge cases such as empty strings, trailing spaces, and case sensitivity as specified.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of \"boredoms\" in a given string.

When a delimiter (., ?, !) is encountered, the current sentence (if not empty) is added to the sentences list, and the current buffer is reset.\n2. **Handling the Last Sentence**: After processing all characters, any remaining content in the current buffer is added to the sentences list.\n3. **Processing Each Sentence**: For each sentence:\n   - **Trimming**: Removes leading and trailing whitespace to handle cases where sentences might have extra spaces.\n   - **Splitting into Words**: The trimmed sentence is split into words using `split_whitespace()`, which handles multiple spaces and ensures words are correctly separated.\n   - **Checking First Word**: The first word of the sentence is checked to see if it is \"I\". If so, the boredom count is incremented.\n4. **Returning the Result**: The total count of boredom sentences is converted to `isize` and returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input string to count sentences starting with \"I\" while handling various edge cases such as empty sentences, leading/trailing spaces, and different delimiters.
