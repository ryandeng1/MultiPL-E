A regular pentagon has five equal sides, so the perimeter is simply five times the length of one side.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the perimeter of a regular pentagon. Since all sides of a regular pentagon are equal, the perimeter can be derived by multiplying the side length by 5.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves a straightforward multiplication of the given side length by 5. This is efficient with a constant time complexity, O(1).\n3. **Implementation**: The function takes an `isize` (a signed integer type) as input and returns the perimeter as an `isize`. The implementation is a single arithmetic operation: `a * 5`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn perimeter_pentagon(a: isize) -> isize {\n    a * 5\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The function `perimeter_pentagon` accepts a single parameter `a` of type `isize`, representing the length of one side of the pentagon.\n- **Calculation**: The perimeter is calculated by multiplying the side length `a` by 5 (since a pentagon has five sides).\n- **Output**: The result of the multiplication is returned as an `isize`, which is the perimeter of the regular pentagon.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the perimeter with minimal operations, leveraging the fundamental property of regular pentagons having equal side lengths. The solution is optimal with constant time and space complexity.", "\n\nTo find the perimeter of a regular pentagon, we multiply the length of one side by 5 since all sides are equal.
