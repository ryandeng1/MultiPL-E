The solution should handle edge cases such as an empty input vector correctly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires inserting a delimiter between each pair of consecutive elements in the input vector. For example, the input vector `[1, 2, 3]` with delimiter `4` should become `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]`. If the input vector is empty, the result should also be an empty vector.\n2. **Intuition**: We can iterate through each element of the input vector. For each element, we add it to the result vector. After adding each element (except the last one), we add the delimiter to the result vector.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Initialize an empty result vector.\n   - Iterate over each element in the input vector using `enumerate` to track the index of each element.\n   - For each element, push it to the result vector.\n   - If the current index is not the last index (i.e., there are more elements to come), push the delimiter to the result vector.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the input vector. This is because each element is processed exactly once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, since the result vector will contain approximately 2n - 1 elements (for a non-empty input).\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn intersperse(numbers: Vec<isize>, delimeter: isize) -> Vec<isize> {\n    let mut result = Vec::new();\n    for (i, &num) in numbers.iter().enumerate() {\n        result.push(num);\n        if i < numbers.len() - 1 {\n            result.push(delimeter);\n        }\n    }\n    result\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by creating an empty vector `result` to store the output.\n2. **Iteration**: Using `numbers.iter().enumerate()`, we loop through each element of the input vector along with its index.\n3. **Element Addition**: For each element `num` at index `i`, we add `num` to `result`.\n4. **Delimiter Addition**: After adding each element (except the last one), we add the delimiter to `result`. The condition `i < numbers.len() - 1` ensures that the delimiter is only added between elements, not after the last element.\n5. **Edge Handling**: If the input vector is empty, the loop does not execute, and `result` remains empty, which meets the problem's requirement.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each element exactly once, ensuring optimal performance and correctness for all valid inputs, including edge cases like empty vectors.", "\n\nTo solve the problem of inserting a delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a vector, we can use a straightforward approach with a loop. The solution iterates through each element of the input vector, appending each element to the result vector, and then inserting the delimiter after each element except the last one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialize an empty result vector** to store the final output.\n2. **Iterate over each element** in the input vector using `enumerate` to track the index of each element.\n3. **Append the current element** to the result vector.\n4. **Check if the current index is not the last index** (i.e., there are more elements to follow). If so, append the delimiter to the result vector.\n5. **Return the result vector** after processing all elements.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases:\n- An empty input vector results in an empty output vector.\n- A single-element input vector results in a single-element output vector (no delimiter is added).\n- Multiple elements result in the delimiter being inserted between each pair of consecutive elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn intersperse(numbers: Vec<isize>, delimeter: isize) -> Vec<isize> {\n    let mut result = Vec::new();\n    for (i, &num) in numbers.iter().enumerate() {\n        result.push(num);\n        if i < numbers.len() - 1 {\n            result.push(delimeter);\n        }\n    }\n    result\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: `let mut result = Vec::new();` creates an empty vector to store the result.\n- **Loop through elements**: The `for (i, &num) in numbers.iter().enumerate()` loop iterates over each element in the input vector, tracking both the index (`i`) and the current element (`num`).\n- **Append element**: Each element `num` is added to the result vector.\n- **Append delimiter**: If the current index `i` is not the last index (`i < numbers.len() - 1`), the delimiter is appended to the result vector.\n- **Return result**: After processing all elements, the result vector is returned.\n\nThis solution efficiently processes the input vector in linear time, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input vector. It handles all edge cases correctly and is both clear and concise.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to insert a specified delimiter between every two consecutive elements of an input vector.
