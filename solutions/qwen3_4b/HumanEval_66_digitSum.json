The ASCII values for uppercase letters range from 65 ('A') to 90 ('Z').\n2. **Key Insight**: For each character in the string, we can check if it is uppercase using Rust's built-in `is_uppercase` method for `char` types. If it is uppercase, we convert the character to its ASCII value (as `isize`) and add it to a running sum.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Using Rust's iterator methods provides a concise and efficient way to process each character in the string:\n   - `chars()` splits the string into individual characters.\n   - `filter(|c| c.is_uppercase())` retains only uppercase characters.\n   - `map(|c| c as isize)` converts each uppercase character to its ASCII value as `isize`.\n   - `sum()` accumulates the total of these values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn digitSum(s: String) -> isize {\n    s.chars()\n        .filter(|c| c.is_uppercase())\n        .map(|c| c as isize)\n        .sum()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a `String` as input.\n2. **Character Processing**: The `chars()` method converts the string into an iterator of individual characters.\n3. **Filtering Uppercase Characters**: The `filter` method checks each character to see if it is uppercase using `c.is_uppercase()`.\n4. **Mapping to ASCII Values**: Each uppercase character is converted to its corresponding ASCII value (as `isize`) using `c as isize`.\n5. **Summing Values**: The `sum()` method accumulates all the ASCII values of the uppercase characters into a single `isize` result.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the string in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the string, making it optimal for the given problem constraints. The solution leverages Rust's powerful iterator methods to achieve clarity and conciseness.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the ASCII codes of all uppercase characters in a given string. The solution involves iterating through each character in the string, checking if it is an uppercase letter, and summing their corresponding ASCII values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iterate through each character**: Use the `chars()` method on the input `String` to get an iterator over each character.\n2. **Filter uppercase characters**: For each character, check if it is uppercase using the `is_uppercase()` method.\n3. **Convert to ASCII values**: Convert each uppercase character to its ASCII value (as an `isize`).\n4. **Sum the values**: Accumulate the ASCII values of all uppercase characters to get the final result.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each character in the string once, making it optimal with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn digitSum(s: String) -> isize {\n    s.chars()\n        .filter(|c| c.is_uppercase())\n        .map(|c| c as isize)\n        .sum()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **`s.chars()`**: This method splits the input `String` into an iterator of individual characters.\n- **`.filter(|c| c.is_uppercase())`**: This filters the iterator to include only characters that are uppercase letters (A-Z).\n- **`.map(|c| c as isize)`**: Each uppercase character is converted to its corresponding ASCII value (as an `isize`).\n- **`.sum()`**: The `sum()` method aggregates all the ASCII values into a single `isize`, which is returned as the result.\n\nThis solution efficiently processes the input string to compute the required sum by leveraging Rust's standard library methods for character handling and iteration.
