This means that characters like 'a' and 'A' should be considered the same.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert to Lowercase**: First, we convert the entire input string to lowercase. This ensures that all characters are in a uniform case, making it easier to compare them without considering case sensitivity.\n2. **Use a HashSet**: We then iterate over each character in the lowercase string and add it to a `HashSet`. A `HashSet` automatically handles uniqueness, so each character is stored only once.\n3. **Count Unique Characters**: The size of the `HashSet` gives us the count of distinct characters, which we return as an `isize`.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging Rust's standard library to convert the string to lowercase and use a set for uniqueness checks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nuse std::collections::HashSet;\n\nfn count_distinct_characters(string: String) -> isize {\n    let lower_string = string.to_lowercase();\n    let mut set = HashSet::new();\n    for c in lower_string.chars() {\n        set.insert(c);\n    }\n    set.len() as isize\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion to Lowercase**: The `string.to_lowercase()` method converts the entire string to lowercase. For example, \"xyzXYZ\" becomes \"xyzxyz\".\n2. **HashSet for Uniqueness**: We iterate over each character in the lowercase string. Each character is added to a `HashSet`, which inherently stores only unique elements. For instance, the characters 'x', 'y', and 'z' will each appear once in the set.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The number of elements in the `HashSet` (obtained via `set.len()`) is converted to `isize` and returned. For the input \"xyzXYZ\", the set contains 'x', 'y', and 'z', so the result is 3.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging Rust's built-in string and collection features to ensure correctness and optimal performance. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, due to the linear operations of converting to lowercase and iterating through the string. The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of distinct characters in the string.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct characters in a given string, ignoring case differences. This means that characters like 'a' and 'A' should be considered the same. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Normalize Case**: Convert the entire string to lowercase (or uppercase) to standardize the case of all characters. This ensures that characters like 'A' and 'a' are treated identically.\n2. **Collect Distinct Characters**: Use a `HashSet` to collect distinct characters from the normalized string. A `HashSet` automatically handles duplicates, so each character appears only once in the set.\n3. **Return Count**: The size of the `HashSet` (i.e., the number of distinct characters) is converted to an `isize` and returned as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging Rust's standard library for case normalization and set operations, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nuse std::collections::HashSet;\n\nfn count_distinct_characters(string: String) -> isize {\n    string.to_lowercase()\n        .chars()\n        .collect::<HashSet<char>>()\n        .len() as isize\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Case Normalization**: The `string.to_lowercase()` method converts the entire string to lowercase. This step ensures that all characters are in a uniform case, making case-insensitive comparison possible.\n2. **Character Collection**: The `chars()` method splits the normalized string into individual characters. These characters are then collected into a `HashSet`, which inherently stores only unique elements.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The `len()` method of the `HashSet` gives the count of distinct characters. This count is converted to an `isize` (as required by the problem) and returned.\n\nFor example:\n- Input `\"xyzXYZ\"` becomes `\"xyzxyz\"` after normalization. The distinct characters are `'x'`, `'y'`, and `'z'`, so the result is `3`.\n- Input `\"Jerry\"` becomes `\"jerry\"` after normalization. The distinct characters are `'j'`, `'e'`, `'r'`, and `'y'`, so the result is `4`.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem requirements with clear and concise code, leveraging Rust's standard library for robust and maintainable implementation.", "\n\nTo solve the problem of counting distinct characters in a string regardless of case, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the entire string to lowercase** to ensure case insensitivity.\n2. **Iterate over each character** in the lowercase string.\n3. **Track unique characters** using a `HashSet`.\n4. **Return the count** of unique characters as an `isize`.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```rust\nuse std::collections::HashSet;\n\nfn count_distinct_characters(string: String) -> isize {\n    let lower_str = string.as_str().to_lowercase();\n    let mut set = HashSet::new();\n    for c in lower_str.chars() {\n        set.insert(c);\n    }\n    set.len() as isize\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `string.as_str().to_lowercase()` converts the input string to lowercase.\n- `HashSet` is used to store unique characters since it automatically handles duplicates.\n- Each character from the lowercase string is added to the set.\n- The size of the set (converted to `isize`) is returned as the result.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles case insensitivity and counts distinct characters in a single pass through the string, leveraging Rust's standard library for optimal performance and clarity."]}
