A right-angled triangle must satisfy the condition that the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Since the input order is arbitrary, we check all three possible assignments of the sides to the hypotenuse.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking if three given side lengths (as `isize` values) can form a right-angled triangle. A right-angled triangle must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: for sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) (with \\(c\\) being the hypotenuse), \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\).\n2. **Key Insight**: The hypotenuse is the longest side in a right-angled triangle. However, since the input order is arbitrary, we need to check all three possibilities where any of the three sides could be the hypotenuse.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We evaluate three conditions:\n   - \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\)\n   - \\(a^2 + c^2 = b^2\\)\n   - \\(b^2 + c^2 = a^2\\)\n   If any of these conditions is true, the sides form a right-angled triangle; otherwise, they do not.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves three multiplications and three comparisons, all of which are constant time operations \\(O(1)\\). This approach is efficient and optimal for the problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn right_angle_triangle(a: isize, b: isize, c: isize) -> bool {\n    (a * a + b * b == c * c) || (a * a + c * c == b * b) || (b * b + c * c == a * a)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Condition Checks**: The function checks three possible scenarios where any of the three sides could be the hypotenuse:\n  1. \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\): Checks if \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.\n  2. \\(a^2 + c^2 = b^2\\): Checks if \\(b\\) is the hypotenuse.\n  3. \\(b^2 + c^2 = a^2\\): Checks if \\(a\\) is the hypotenuse.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns `true` if any of the conditions is satisfied, indicating the sides form a right-angled triangle; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently checks all possibilities in constant time with minimal operations, making it optimal for the given problem.\n\nThis approach ensures correctness for all valid inputs by leveraging the Pythagorean theorem without needing to sort the sides, directly checking all possible hypotenuse assignments. The solution handles the arbitrary input order and efficiently verifies the right-angled triangle condition.", "\n\nTo determine if three given side lengths form a right-angled triangle, we can leverage the Pythagorean theorem. A right-angled triangle must satisfy the condition that the square of the longest side (hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. \n\nThe solution involves checking all three possible combinations where one side could be the hypotenuse:\n1. `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 == c\u00b2`\n2. `a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 == b\u00b2`\n3. `b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 == a\u00b2`\n\nThis approach efficiently covers all scenarios without explicitly sorting the sides, as the Pythagorean condition inherently requires the hypotenuse to be the largest side. The solution handles positive integers (as side lengths must be positive) and avoids unnecessary checks for triangle validity (since the Pythagorean condition implies the triangle inequality holds for valid right-angled triangles).\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```rust\nfn right_angle_triangle(a: isize, b: isize, c: isize) -> bool {\n    (a * a + b * b == c * c) || (a * a + c * c == b * b) || (b * b + c * c == a * a)\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The function checks all three permutations of the Pythagorean theorem condition.\n- For each pair of sides, it squares them and checks if their sum equals the square of the third side.\n- The condition returns `true` if any of the three conditions are satisfied, indicating the sides form a right-angled triangle; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n- `right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)` returns `true` because `3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 5\u00b2` (9 + 16 = 25).\n- `right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)` returns `false` because none of the conditions hold (1 + 4 \u2260 9, 1 + 9 \u2260 4, 4 + 9 \u2260 1).\n\nThis solution is concise, efficient, and correctly handles the problem requirements for integer side lengths.", "\n\nTo determine if three given side lengths form a right-angled triangle, we need to check two conditions:\n1. All sides must be positive (since triangle side lengths are positive).\n2. The Pythagorean theorem must hold: the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides must equal the square of the largest side.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Non-Positive Sides**: If any side is zero or negative, it cannot form a valid triangle, so return `false`.\n2. **Sort the Sides**: Sort the three sides in ascending order to easily identify the two smaller sides and the largest side (hypotenuse).\n3. **Check Pythagorean Condition**: Verify if the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides equals the square of the largest side. If true, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the necessary conditions for a right-angled triangle by leveraging sorting and a straightforward application of the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn right_angle_triangle(a: isize, b: isize, c: isize) -> bool {\n    if a <= 0 || b <= 0 || c <= 0 {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    let mut sides = [a, b, c];\n    sides.sort();\n    sides[0] * sides[0] + sides[1] * sides[1] == sides[2] * sides[2]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Non-Positive Check**: The function first checks if any side length is zero or negative. If so, it immediately returns `false` because a triangle cannot have non-positive side lengths.\n2. **Sorting Sides**: The three side lengths are stored in an array and sorted in ascending order. This allows us to easily access the two smallest sides (at indices 0 and 1) and the largest side (at index 2).\n3. **Pythagorean Check**: The function then checks if the sum of the squares of the two smallest sides equals the square of the largest side. If this condition is met, the sides form a right-angled triangle, and the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by leveraging sorting and a direct check of the Pythagorean theorem, ensuring correctness for all valid triangle side lengths. The approach is optimal for the given constraints and problem requirements."]}
