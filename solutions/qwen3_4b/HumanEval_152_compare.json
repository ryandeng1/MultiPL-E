The solution involves computing the absolute difference between each corresponding element in the two input vectors (the actual scores and the guesses) and returning a new vector containing these differences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires comparing two vectors of equal length. For each index `i`, we compute the absolute difference between the actual score `game[i]` and the guessed score `guess[i]`.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating over both vectors in parallel, we can efficiently compute the required differences. The key insight is that using the `zip` function allows us to pair elements from both vectors simultaneously.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Use `iter()` to get references to each element in the vectors.\n   - Use `zip()` to pair corresponding elements from the two iterators.\n   - For each pair, compute the absolute difference using `(a - b).abs()`.\n   - Collect all these differences into a new vector using `collect()`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where `n` is the length of the input vectors. This is because we process each element exactly once. The space complexity is O(n) to store the resulting vector.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn compare(game: Vec<isize>, guess: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    game.iter()\n        .zip(guess.iter())\n        .map(|(a, b)| (a - b).abs())\n        .collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Iterating with `zip`**: The `game.iter()` and `guess.iter()` methods create iterators that reference each element in the respective vectors. The `zip()` function combines these iterators into pairs of elements (e.g., `(game[0], guess[0])`, `(game[1], guess[1])`, etc.).\n2. **Computing Absolute Differences**: For each pair `(a, b)`, the expression `(a - b).abs()` computes the absolute difference between the actual score `a` and the guessed score `b`.\n3. **Collecting Results**: The `map` function applies the absolute difference computation to each pair, and the `collect()` method gathers these results into a new vector of `isize` values.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input vectors in linear time, producing the desired output vector where each element represents how far off the corresponding guess was from the actual score.
