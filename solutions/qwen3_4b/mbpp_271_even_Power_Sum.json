The first `n` even natural numbers are `2, 4, 6, ..., 2n`. \n\nThe approach is straightforward:\n1. Iterate from `1` to `n` (inclusive).\n2. For each integer `i`, compute the even number as `2 * i`.\n3. Raise this even number to the fifth power.\n4. Accumulate the result in a running total.\n5. Convert the intermediate results (which are in `i64` to avoid overflow during exponentiation) to `isize` for the final sum.\n\nThis method ensures that intermediate calculations use 64-bit integers for precision during exponentiation, which is safe for typical inputs (as the problem implies `n` is small enough for the result to fit in `isize`). The loop handles `n = 0` naturally (returns 0) and non-negative `n` as required.\n\n```rust\nfn even_Power_Sum(n: isize) -> isize {\n    let mut total = 0;\n    for i in 1..=n {\n        total += (2 * i as i64).pow(5) as isize;\n    }\n    total\n}\n```", "\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers raised to the fifth power, we can use a straightforward loop-based approach. Each even natural number is of the form `2 * k` where `k` ranges from `1` to `n`. We compute the fifth power of each such number and accumulate the sum.\n\nHere's the implementation in Rust:\n\n```rust\nfn even_Power_Sum(n: isize) -> isize {\n    let mut sum = 0;\n    for k in 1..=n {\n        let num = 2 * k;\n        sum += num * num * num * num * num;\n    }\n    sum\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We start with `sum = 0`.\n2. **Loop**: For each integer `k` from `1` to `n` (inclusive):\n   - Compute the even number as `num = 2 * k`.\n   - Compute the fifth power of `num` by multiplying it by itself five times.\n   - Add this value to `sum`.\n3. **Return**: After processing all values of `k`, return the accumulated `sum`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly compute the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers raised to the fifth power without relying on potentially complex or less reliable methods like the `pow` method (which may have type or implementation nuances in Rust).\n\n### Example:\n- For `n = 1`, the sum is `2^5 = 32`.\n- For `n = 2`, the sum is `2^5 + 4^5 = 32 + 1024 = 1056`.\n- For `n = 3`, the sum is `2^5 + 4^5 + 6^5 = 32 + 1024 + 7776 = 8832`.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem using basic arithmetic operations and a simple loop, ensuring correctness and clarity. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n```rust\nfn even_Power_Sum(n: isize) -> isize {\n    let mut sum = 0;\n    for k in 1..=n {\n        let num = 2 * k;\n        sum += num * num * num * num * num;\n    }\n    sum\n}\n```"]}
