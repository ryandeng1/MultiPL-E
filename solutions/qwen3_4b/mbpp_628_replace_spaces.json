The solution should efficiently process the string and return a new string where every space character is replaced by `%20`.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach is straightforward and leverages Rust's built-in string manipulation capabilities. The `String::replace` method is used to replace all occurrences of a specified substring (in this case, a single space character) with another substring (`%20`). This method efficiently processes the entire string in linear time, making it optimal for this task.\n\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires replacing every space character (`' '`) in the input string with `%20`. The solution must handle the entire string without any additional overhead.\n2. **Insight**: Rust's `String` type provides a built-in method `replace` that can replace all occurrences of a substring with another substring. Since we are replacing a single space character, we can pass `\" \"` (a string literal representing a space) as the substring to replace.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Using `string.replace(\" \", \"%20\")` is the most efficient and concise solution. This method scans the string once, replacing each space with `%20` in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(n) because each character in the string is processed exactly once. The space complexity is O(n) to store the resulting string, which is the same size as the input string (since `%20` is 3 characters and each space is replaced by 3 characters).\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn replace_spaces(string: String) -> String {\n    string.replace(\" \", \"%20\")\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Signature**: The function `replace_spaces` takes a `String` as input and returns a new `String`.\n- **Replacement Logic**: The `replace` method is called on the input string with `\" \"` (a space character) as the substring to replace and `\"%20\"` as the replacement string. This method efficiently scans the entire string, replacing every occurrence of a space with `%20`.\n- **Result**: The function returns a new string where all spaces have been replaced by `%20`, meeting the problem's requirements.\n\nThis solution is both efficient and concise, leveraging Rust's standard library to handle the string manipulation with minimal code. The approach ensures optimal performance and correctness for the given problem.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to replace all spaces in a given string with the substring `%20`. The solution should efficiently handle the replacement of every space character in the input string.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach is straightforward:\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires replacing every occurrence of a space character (`' '`) in the input string with the string `%20`.\n2. **Key Insight**: Rust's `String` type provides a built-in method `replace_all` that can replace all occurrences of a substring within a string with another substring. Since we are dealing with a single space character, we can use this method to efficiently perform the replacement.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Using `string.replace_all(\" \", \"%20\")` directly replaces all space characters in the input string with `%20`. This method is optimal because it handles the replacement in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the string, and it avoids creating unnecessary intermediate strings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn replace_spaces(string: String) -> String {\n    string.replace_all(\" \", \"%20\")\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `replace_spaces` takes a `String` as input and returns a new `String`.\n- **Replacement**: The `replace_all` method is called on the input string. It scans the entire string and replaces every occurrence of the space character (`\" \"`) with the string `%20`.\n- **Efficiency**: The `replace_all` method is implemented in Rust's standard library to be efficient, processing the string in a single pass. This ensures optimal performance even for large input strings.\n- **Correctness**: The solution correctly replaces all space characters with `%20` without affecting other characters or whitespace (like tabs or newlines), adhering to the problem's requirement to replace only spaces.\n\nThis solution is concise, efficient, and leverages Rust's standard library for clean and readable code.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to replace all occurrences of spaces in a given string with the substring `%20`. The solution should efficiently handle the replacement while preserving the rest of the string's content.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves using Rust's built-in string replacement functionality. The `String` type in Rust provides a `replace` method that replaces all occurrences of a specified substring with another substring. In this case:\n1. We target the space character (`\" \"`) as the substring to replace.\n2. We replace each occurrence of this space with the string `%20`.\n3. The `replace` method processes the entire string in linear time, making it efficient for this task.\n\nThis approach is straightforward and leverages Rust's standard library to achieve the desired result without manual iteration or complex string manipulation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn replace_spaces(string: String) -> String {\n    string.replace(\" \", \"%20\")\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires replacing every space character in the input string with `%20`. The solution must handle all spaces in the string, including consecutive spaces.\n2. **Intuition**: Using Rust's `replace` method is optimal because it directly addresses the problem by replacing all instances of a substring (in this case, a single space) with the target string (`%20`).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The `replace` method is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency. It scans the string once, replacing each space with `%20` in linear time.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
