The goal is to compute the area of the triangle using these values.\n2. **Key Insight**: The area calculation involves multiplying the base and height and then dividing the product by 2. Since the result must be a floating-point number (f64), we convert the integer inputs to f64 before performing the arithmetic operations.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves a simple arithmetic operation: convert both integers to f64, multiply them, and then divide the result by 2.0 to ensure floating-point division.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn triangle_area(a: isize, h: isize) -> f64 {\n    (a as f64) * (h as f64) / 2.0\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Type Conversion**: The integers `a` (base) and `h` (height) are converted to `f64` to perform floating-point arithmetic.\n2. **Multiplication and Division**: The converted values are multiplied together, and the product is divided by `2.0` to get the area of the triangle.\n3. **Result**: The result is returned as a `f64`, ensuring the output is a precise floating-point number (e.g., `7.5` for inputs `5` and `3`).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the triangle area using basic arithmetic operations and type conversion, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.
