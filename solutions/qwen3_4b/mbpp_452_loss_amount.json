If there is no loss (i.e., the sale amount is greater than or equal to the actual cost), we should return 0.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The function takes two parameters: `actual_cost` (the cost at which the item was purchased) and `sale_amount` (the amount received from selling the item). \n2. **Key Insight**: A loss occurs when the `sale_amount` is less than the `actual_cost`. The loss amount is calculated as the difference between `actual_cost` and `sale_amount`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Check if `sale_amount` is less than `actual_cost`.\n   - If true, return the difference (`actual_cost - sale_amount`).\n   - Otherwise, return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn loss_amount(actual_cost: isize, sale_amount: isize) -> isize {\n    if sale_amount < actual_cost {\n        actual_cost - sale_amount\n    } else {\n        0\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Condition Check**: The function first checks if the `sale_amount` is less than the `actual_cost`. This condition determines whether a loss has occurred.\n- **Loss Calculation**: If the condition is met (i.e., `sale_amount < actual_cost`), the function calculates the loss as `actual_cost - sale_amount`, which is a positive value representing the amount lost.\n- **No Loss Handling**: If the condition is not met (i.e., `sale_amount >= actual_cost`), the function returns 0, indicating no loss.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the presence of a loss and computes the loss amount when it exists, ensuring optimal performance with constant time complexity O(1). The solution handles all edge cases, including negative values, by strictly adhering to the problem's conditions.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the loss amount from a sale when the sale amount is less than the actual cost. If the sale amount is greater than or equal to the actual cost, there is no loss, and we should return 0.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the loss amount as the difference between the actual cost and the sale amount if the sale amount is less than the actual cost. Otherwise, we return 0.\n2. **Key Insight**: The loss amount is positive only when the sale amount is less than the actual cost. In all other cases (sale amount \u2265 actual cost), the loss amount is 0.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We can compute the difference `actual_cost - sale_amount`. If this difference is positive, it represents the loss amount; otherwise, we return 0. This can be efficiently handled using the `max` function to ensure the result is non-negative.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn loss_amount(actual_cost: isize, sale_amount: isize) -> isize {\n    (actual_cost - sale_amount).max(0)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Difference Calculation**: The expression `actual_cost - sale_amount` calculates the potential loss amount. For example:\n   - If `actual_cost` is 100 and `sale_amount` is 90, the difference is 10, which is the loss amount.\n   - If `actual_cost` is 100 and `sale_amount` is 100, the difference is 0, so no loss.\n   - If `actual_cost` is 100 and `sale_amount` is 110, the difference is -10, indicating a profit (no loss).\n2. **Max Function**: The `.max(0)` method ensures that if the difference is negative (indicating a profit), the result is clamped to 0. This efficiently handles all cases where there is no loss.\n3. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in constant time O(1) since it involves only basic arithmetic operations and a single comparison.\n\nThis approach concisely and correctly computes the loss amount by leveraging the `max` function to handle edge cases where the sale amount exceeds the actual cost, ensuring optimal performance and clarity.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the loss amount on a sale if the sale amount is less than the actual cost.

A loss is defined as the scenario where the sale amount is less than the actual cost.\n- **Key Insight**: The difference `actual_cost - sale_amount` will be positive when there is a loss. If this difference is negative or zero, it means there is no loss, and we should return 0.\n- **Algorithm Selection**: Using the `max` function ensures that the result is never negative. Specifically, `(actual_cost - sale_amount).max(0)` computes the difference and ensures it is at least 0. This approach efficiently handles both scenarios (loss or no loss) in a single line of code without explicit conditional statements.\n- **Complexity**: The solution operates in constant time O(1) since it involves only basic arithmetic operations and a comparison.\n\nThis approach is concise, efficient, and clearly expresses the requirement to return the loss amount when applicable or 0 otherwise."]}
