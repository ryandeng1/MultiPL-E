The vowels considered are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (case-insensitive), and 'y' is explicitly excluded from being a vowel.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Vowels**: We first define a string containing all vowels in both lowercase and uppercase (i.e., \"aeiouAEIOU\").\n2. **Collect Vowels**: Traverse the input string to collect all vowels into a separate vector.\n3. **Reverse Vowels**: Reverse the collected vowels vector.\n4. **Replace Vowels**: Traverse the original string again, replacing each vowel with the next vowel from the reversed vector (in order).\n5. **Construct Result**: Convert the modified vector back into a string and return it.\n\nThis approach efficiently isolates the vowels, reverses them, and places them back in the original string positions while maintaining the order of non-vowel characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn reverse_vowels(str1: String) -> String {\n    let mut chars = str1.chars().collect::<Vec<_>>();\n    let mut vowels = Vec::new();\n    let vowels_str = \"aeiouAEIOU\";\n\n    for c in chars.iter() {\n        if vowels_str.contains(c) {\n            vowels.push(*c);\n        }\n    }\n\n    vowels.reverse();\n\n    let mut index = 0;\n    for c in chars.iter_mut() {\n        if vowels_str.contains(*c) {\n            *c = vowels[index];\n            index += 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    chars.into_iter().collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Collecting Vowels**: The input string is converted into a vector of characters. We iterate through each character to check if it is a vowel (using the predefined `vowels_str`). If it is, the character is added to the `vowels` vector.\n2. **Reversing Vowels**: The collected vowels vector is reversed to prepare them for placement back into the original string.\n3. **Replacing Vowels**: We traverse the original vector again. For each vowel encountered, we replace it with the next vowel from the reversed `vowels` vector (starting from the beginning of the reversed vector).\n4. **Result Construction**: The modified vector of characters is converted back into a string and returned as the result.\n\nThis method ensures that only the vowels are reversed in place while all other characters remain in their original positions, meeting the problem requirements efficiently. The solution handles both uppercase and lowercase vowels correctly and explicitly excludes 'y' as a vowel. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, due to the two linear passes through the string (one for collecting vowels and one for replacing them). The space complexity is O(n) for storing the characters and vowels.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to reverse only the vowels in a given string while leaving all other characters unchanged. The vowels considered are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (case-insensitive), and 'y' is explicitly excluded from being a vowel.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Vowels**: First, we iterate through each character in the input string to collect all vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) into a vector. This vector maintains the order in which vowels appear in the original string.\n2. **Reverse Vowels**: The collected vowels vector is then reversed to get the vowels in the reverse order of their appearance.\n3. **Construct Result String**: We traverse the original string again. For each character in the original string:\n   - If the character is a vowel, we replace it with the next vowel from the reversed vowels vector.\n   - If the character is not a vowel, we keep it unchanged in the result string.\n\nThis approach efficiently reverses the vowels in place while preserving the non-vowel characters and their original positions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn reverse_vowels(str1: String) -> String {\n    let is_vowel = |c: char| {\n        c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u' ||\n        c == 'A' || c == 'E' || c == 'I' || c == 'O' || c == 'U'\n    };\n\n    let mut vowels = Vec::new();\n    for c in str1.chars() {\n        if is_vowel(c) {\n            vowels.push(c);\n        }\n    }\n    vowels.reverse();\n\n    let mut result = String::new();\n    let mut idx = 0;\n    for c in str1.chars() {\n        if is_vowel(c) {\n            result.push(vowels[idx]);\n            idx += 1;\n        } else {\n            result.push(c);\n        }\n    }\n\n    result\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Vowel Identification**: The closure `is_vowel` checks if a character is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u').\n2. **Collecting Vowels**: We iterate through each character in the input string `str1`, collecting all vowels into a vector `vowels` in the order they appear.\n3. **Reversing Vowels**: The `vowels` vector is reversed to prepare the vowels for placement in the result string in reverse order.\n4. **Building Result String**: We iterate through the original string again. For each vowel encountered, we replace it with the next vowel from the reversed `vowels` vector. Non-vowel characters are added to the result string unchanged.\n5. **Result Construction**: The result string is built character by character during the second pass, ensuring only vowels are reversed while all other characters remain in their original positions.\n\nThis method efficiently handles the reversal of vowels in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and uses O(n) additional space to store the vowels. The solution meets the problem requirements by correctly reversing vowels while excluding 'y' as a vowel.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to reverse only the vowels in a given string while preserving the case of the vowels and leaving non-vowels unchanged. The problem specifies that 'y' is not considered a vowel. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Vowels**: Traverse the input string to collect all vowels (case-insensitive) into a vector. Vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' (case-insensitive).\n2. **Reverse Vowels**: Reverse the collected vowels vector.\n3. **Construct Result String**: Traverse the original string again. For each character:\n   - If it is a vowel, replace it with the next vowel from the reversed vowels vector.\n   - If it is not a vowel, keep it unchanged in the result string.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the string in two passes: one to collect vowels and another to construct the result string with vowels reversed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn reverse_vowels(str1: String) -> String {\n    let vowels: Vec<char> = str1.chars()\n        .filter(|c| {\n            let c_low = c.to_ascii_lowercase();\n            \"aeiou\".contains(&c_low)\n        })\n        .collect();\n\n    let reversed_vowels = vowels.into_iter().rev().collect();\n\n    let mut result = String::new();\n    let mut idx = 0;\n    for c in str1.chars() {\n        let c_low = c.to_ascii_lowercase();\n        if \"aeiou\".contains(&c_low) {\n            result.push(reversed_vowels[idx]);\n            idx += 1;\n        } else {\n            result.push(c);\n        }\n    }\n\n    result\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Collecting Vowels**: The first loop processes each character in the input string. For each character, it converts it to lowercase and checks if it is a vowel (i.e., present in the string \"aeiou\"). Valid vowels are collected into a vector.\n2. **Reversing Vowels**: The collected vowels vector is reversed to get the vowels in reverse order.\n3. **Building Result String**: The second loop processes each character in the original string:\n   - For vowels, it replaces the character with the next vowel from the reversed vowels vector (starting from the beginning of the reversed vector).\n   - For non-vowels, the character is added to the result string as-is.\n   \nThis method ensures that only vowels are reversed while maintaining the original case and positions of non-vowels. The solution efficiently handles case insensitivity and correctly ignores 'y' as specified.\n\n**Example**: \n- Input: `\"Hello\"`\n- Vowels collected: `['e', 'o']`\n- Reversed vowels: `['o', 'e']`\n- Result: `\"Holle\"` (vowels 'e' and 'o' become 'o' and 'e' in the string)"]}
