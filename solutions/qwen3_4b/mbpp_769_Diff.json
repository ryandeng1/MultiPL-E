The function should perform element-wise subtraction of the second vector from the first vector, and it must ensure both vectors have the same length to avoid undefined behavior.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```rust\nfn Diff(li1: Vec<isize>, li2: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    if li1.len() != li2.len() {\n        panic!(\"Vectors have different lengths\");\n    }\n    li1.iter()\n       .zip(li2.iter())\n       .map(|(a, b)| *a - *b)\n       .collect()\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. **Length Check:** The function first checks if both vectors have the same length. If not, it panics with a clear error message (since vector subtraction requires matching dimensions).\n2. **Element-wise Subtraction:** Using `zip` to pair corresponding elements from both vectors, it computes the difference (`*a - *b`) for each pair.\n3. **Result Collection:** The results are collected into a new `Vec<isize>`.\n\nThis implementation is safe, efficient (using Rust's iterator patterns), and handles the edge case of mismatched lengths explicitly. The function name `Diff` matches the problem's specification.\n\n**Note:** The problem mentions \"rsthon\" which is likely a typo for \"Rust\". This solution follows Rust conventions and best practices.", "\n\nThe function `Diff` computes the element-wise difference between two vectors of `isize` values. It uses Rust's iterator methods for efficiency and clarity. The implementation handles vectors of any length (including empty vectors) by processing elements in parallel using `zip`, which stops at the shorter vector if lengths differ (this is a common convention for element-wise operations in Rust). \n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```rust\nfn Diff(li1: Vec<isize>, li2: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    li1.iter().zip(li2.iter()).map(|(a, b)| a - b).collect()\n}\n```\n\n**Key points:**\n- **Element-wise subtraction**: For each index `i`, computes `li1[i] - li2[i]`.\n- **Handles different lengths**: If vectors have different lengths, the result will be the length of the shorter vector (as `zip` stops at the first vector's end).\n- **Efficiency**: Uses Rust's iterator patterns for optimal performance without manual loops.\n- **Edge cases**: Works correctly for empty vectors and vectors of the same length.\n\n**Example usage:**\n```rust\nlet v1 = vec![10, 20, 30];\nlet v2 = vec![5, 15, 25];\nlet result = Diff(v1, v2); // Returns [5, 5, 5]\n```\n\nThis solution adheres to Rust best practices and the problem's requirements for a vector difference function. The term \"rsthon\" appears to be a typo for \"Rust\" (common in informal contexts), so the solution is written in standard Rust.", "\n\nThe problem appears to have a typo (\"rsthon\" likely means \"Rust\"). Here's the correct Rust function to compute the difference between two vectors of `isize`:\n\n```rust\nfn Diff(li1: Vec<isize>, li2: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    if li1.len() != li2.len() {\n        panic!(\"Vectors must be of the same length\");\n    }\n    li1.iter().zip(li2.iter()).map(|(a, b)| a - b).collect()\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. **Length Check**: The function first checks if both vectors have the same length. If not, it panics with a clear error message (since vector differences require matching lengths).\n2. **Zip and Map**: Using `iter().zip()`, we pair corresponding elements from both vectors. The `map` function then computes the difference (`a - b`) for each pair.\n3. **Collect**: The results are collected into a new `Vec<isize>`.\n\n**Why this works:**\n- The `zip` iterator efficiently pairs elements from both vectors without manual indexing.\n- The `map` function applies the subtraction operation to each pair.\n- The `collect` method converts the iterator into a vector.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```rust\nlet v1 = vec![5, 3, 8];\nlet v2 = vec![2, 1, 4];\nlet result = Diff(v1, v2); // Returns [3, 2, 4]\n```\n\nThis implementation is concise, efficient, and handles the required vector difference correctly. The panic for mismatched lengths ensures the function behaves as expected in linear algebra contexts where vector operations require same-length inputs."]}
