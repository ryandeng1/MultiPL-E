The height is ignored since it's not needed for the median calculation.\n- **Conversion to `f64`:** The bases are converted from `isize` to `f64` to ensure floating-point division.\n- **Division by 2.0:** The sum of the bases is divided by `2.0` (a floating-point literal) to get the median as a `f64`.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```rust\nlet median = median_trapezium(5, 7, 10); // Returns 6.0\n```\n\nThis function correctly computes the median length of a trapezium using the standard formula, regardless of the provided height.\n\n**Note:** The problem specifies the function takes three parameters, but the height is unused in the calculation.
