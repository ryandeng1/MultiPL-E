The problem statement mentions \"remove lowercase substrings,\" but in this context, it refers to removing every character that is a lowercase letter (i.e., each lowercase character is considered a substring of length 1). The solution involves iterating through each character in the string and excluding any lowercase characters from the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to process a string and produce a new string that contains only the characters that are not lowercase letters. This includes uppercase letters, digits, punctuation, and other non-lowercase characters.\n2. **Key Insight**: Each lowercase character (from 'a' to 'z') should be excluded from the result. Non-lowercase characters (like uppercase letters, digits, symbols) should be retained.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use Rust's iterator capabilities to efficiently process each character in the input string. For each character, we check if it is not a lowercase letter using the `is_ascii_lowercase` method. Characters that pass this check are collected into a new string.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character in the string exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the resulting string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn remove_lowercase(str1: String) -> String {\n    str1.chars()\n        .filter(|c| !c.is_ascii_lowercase())\n        .collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character Iteration**: The `str1.chars()` method converts the input string into an iterator of individual characters.\n2. **Filtering Lowercase Characters**: The `filter` method is used to exclude characters that are lowercase. The condition `!c.is_ascii_lowercase()` checks if a character is not a lowercase ASCII letter (i.e., it is uppercase, a digit, a symbol, etc.).\n3. **Collecting Results**: The filtered characters are collected into a new `String` using the `collect` method, which constructs the result string from the remaining characters.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input string in linear time, ensuring optimal performance while correctly removing all lowercase characters as specified. The solution handles all edge cases, including strings with no lowercase characters, by simply returning the original string.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to remove all lowercase letters from a given string. The problem statement mentions \"remove lowercase substrings,\" but in the context of this function, it is interpreted as removing each individual lowercase character (since a substring of length 1 is a single character). This interpretation aligns with common programming problems where the goal is to filter out lowercase letters from a string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires processing each character in the input string and excluding any lowercase letters (i.e., 'a' to 'z'). The solution should efficiently construct a new string that contains only the characters that are not lowercase.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each character in the input string, we can check if it is a lowercase letter. If it is not, we include it in the result string.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use Rust's iterator methods to process each character in the string. Specifically, we:\n   - Convert the input string into an iterator of characters (`str1.chars()`).\n   - Filter out characters that are lowercase using `filter(|c| !c.is_ascii_lowercase())`.\n   - Collect the remaining characters into a new string using `collect()`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn remove_lowercase(str1: String) -> String {\n    str1.chars().filter(|c| !c.is_ascii_lowercase()).collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a `String` as input (`str1`).\n2. **Character Processing**: The input string is converted into an iterator of its characters using `str1.chars()`.\n3. **Filtering Lowercase Characters**: Each character is checked to see if it is not a lowercase letter. The `is_ascii_lowercase()` method returns `true` for ASCII lowercase letters ('a'-'z'), so we exclude these by using `!c.is_ascii_lowercase()`.\n4. **Result Construction**: The filtered characters are collected into a new `String` using `collect()`, which forms the result without any lowercase letters.\n5. **Output**: The resulting `String` is returned, containing only uppercase letters, digits, punctuation, and other non-lowercase characters from the input.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input string in linear time and produces the desired output by leveraging Rust's powerful iterator and collection features. The solution is concise, readable, and handles all edge cases (like empty strings or strings with no lowercase characters) correctly.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to remove all lowercase substrings from a given string. The key insight here is that each lowercase letter can be considered a substring of length 1. Therefore, the task simplifies to filtering out all characters that are lowercase letters from the input string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires removing every lowercase letter from the input string. The term \"lowercase substrings\" in the problem statement likely refers to individual lowercase letters (substrings of length 1) rather than contiguous sequences of lowercase letters. This interpretation is common in such programming problems, especially for beginner exercises.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each character in the string, we can check if it is a lowercase letter. If it is, we skip it; otherwise, we include it in the result.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use Rust's `chars()` method to iterate over each character in the string. For each character, we check if it is not an ASCII lowercase letter using `is_ascii_lowercase()`. Characters that pass this check (i.e., are not lowercase) are collected into a new string.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character in the string exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
