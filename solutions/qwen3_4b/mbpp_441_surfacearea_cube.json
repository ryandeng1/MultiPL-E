For example:\n- If `l = 3`, the surface area is \\(6 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 54\\).\n- If `l = -2`, the surface area is \\(6 \\times (-2) \\times (-2) = 24\\) (mathematically consistent).\n\nThe solution efficiently computes the result without additional checks or operations, adhering to the problem constraints.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to compute the surface area of a cube given its side length. The surface area of a cube is calculated using the formula \\(6 \\times \\text{side length}^2\\). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires us to compute the surface area of a cube where the side length is provided as an integer (`isize`). The solution involves squaring the side length and multiplying the result by 6.\n2. **Key Insight**: The surface area formula for a cube is straightforward: \\(6 \\times l^2\\), where \\(l\\) is the side length. This formula accounts for all six faces of the cube, each having an area of \\(l^2\\).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The algorithm involves a simple arithmetic operation: multiply the side length by itself (squaring) and then multiply the result by 6. This operation is efficient with constant time complexity \\(O(1)\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn surfacearea_cube(l: isize) -> isize {\n    6 * l * l\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `surfacearea_cube` takes an integer parameter `l` of type `isize` (representing the side length of the cube) and returns an `isize` (the surface area).\n2. **Calculation**: The expression `6 * l * l` computes the surface area by:\n   - Squaring the side length (`l * l`).\n   - Multiplying the squared value by 6 to get the total surface area of all six faces of the cube.\n3. **Efficiency**: The operation involves only basic arithmetic (multiplication), making it very efficient with constant time complexity \\(O(1)\\). This ensures the solution is optimal for any valid input within the range of `isize`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the surface area of a cube using a direct application of the geometric formula, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.", "\n\nTo find the surface area of a cube given its side length `l`, we use the formula for the surface area of a cube, which is `6 * l^2`.
