The non-digit characters should form the prefix of the result string, and the digits should form the suffix.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each character in the input string, we can categorize each character as either a digit or a non-digit. We then concatenate the non-digit characters followed by the digit characters to form the result string.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a simple loop to traverse each character in the input string. For each character:\n   - If it is a digit (0-9), it is added to a `digits` string.\n   - Otherwise, it is added to a `non_digits` string.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(n) to store the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn move_num(test_str: String) -> String {\n    let mut non_digits = String::new();\n    let mut digits = String::new();\n\n    for c in test_str.chars() {\n        if c.is_digit(10) {\n            digits.push(c);\n        } else {\n            non_digits.push(c);\n        }\n    }\n\n    non_digits + &digits\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Two empty strings, `non_digits` and `digits`, are initialized to collect non-digit and digit characters respectively.\n2. **Character Processing**: The loop iterates over each character in the input string:\n   - If the character is a digit (checked using `is_digit(10)`), it is appended to `digits`.\n   - Otherwise, it is appended to `non_digits`.\n3. **Result Construction**: After processing all characters, the result string is formed by concatenating `non_digits` (all non-digit characters in order) followed by `digits` (all digit characters in order).\n\nThis approach efficiently separates and reorganizes the characters as required, ensuring optimal performance with minimal overhead. The solution handles all edge cases, including empty strings and strings composed entirely of digits or non-digits.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to move all the numeric digits (0-9) from a given string to the end of the string while preserving the original order of both the non-digit characters and the digits themselves.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves processing each character in the input string to separate digits from non-digits. The goal is to form a new string where all non-digit characters appear first (in their original order), followed by all digit characters (in their original order).\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each character in the string, we can categorize each character as either a digit or a non-digit. We then construct two separate strings: one containing all non-digit characters and another containing all digit characters. The final result is the concatenation of the non-digit string followed by the digit string.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Use the `chars()` method to iterate over each character in the input string.\n   - Filter characters to collect non-digits into one string and digits into another.\n   - Concatenate the non-digit string with the digit string to form the result.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character in the string exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(n) to store the resulting strings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn move_num(test_str: String) -> String {\n    let non_nums = test_str.chars().filter(|c| !c.is_digit(10)).collect::<String>();\n    let nums = test_str.chars().filter(|c| c.is_digit(10)).collect::<String>();\n    non_nums + &nums\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Filtering Characters**: \n   - The `test_str.chars()` method converts the input string into an iterator of individual characters.\n   - The first filter (`filter(|c| !c.is_digit(10))`) collects all characters that are not digits (0-9) into a `String` named `non_nums`.\n   - The second filter (`filter(|c| c.is_digit(10))`) collects all digit characters into another `String` named `nums`.\n2. **Concatenation**: The final result is obtained by concatenating `non_nums` (non-digit characters in order) with `nums` (digits in order), producing the desired output string where all digits are moved to the end.\n\nThis approach efficiently separates and reorders the characters as required, ensuring optimal performance and correctness for the given problem constraints.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to move all the digits (0-9) from a given string to the end of the string while maintaining the original order of non-digit characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves processing each character in the input string to separate digits from non-digits. The goal is to place all non-digit characters first followed by all digit characters.\n2. **Key Insight**: By iterating through each character in the string and categorizing them into non-digits and digits, we can construct the result string by concatenating the non-digit characters followed by the digit characters.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use Rust's `partition` method on the iterator of characters to split the string into two parts: characters that are not digits and characters that are digits. This efficiently separates the two types of characters in a single pass.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the separated characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn move_num(test_str: String) -> String {\n    let (non_digits, digits) = test_str.chars().partition(|c| !c.is_digit(10));\n    non_digits.collect::<String>() + &digits.collect::<String>()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Partitioning Characters**: The `partition` method splits the characters of the input string into two parts:\n   - `non_digits`: Characters that are not digits (i.e., `!c.is_digit(10)` is true).\n   - `digits`: Characters that are digits (i.e., `c.is_digit(10)` is true).\n2. **Collecting into Strings**: Each partitioned iterator is converted into a `String` using the `collect` method.\n3. **Concatenation**: The resulting strings from the non-digit and digit partitions are concatenated to form the final output string, where all non-digit characters precede all digit characters.\n\nThis approach efficiently separates and reorders the characters in a single pass through the input string, ensuring optimal performance and correctness for all valid inputs."]}
