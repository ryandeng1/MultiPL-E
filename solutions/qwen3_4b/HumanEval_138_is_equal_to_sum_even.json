Therefore, the smallest possible sum of 4 such numbers is \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8\\). Any number less than 8 cannot be expressed as such a sum.\n2. **Parity Check**: The sum of four even numbers is always even (since even + even = even, and this property holds for four numbers). Thus, if `n` is odd, it cannot be expressed as the sum of four even numbers.\n3. **Sufficient Condition**: For any even number `n` that is at least 8, we can always express it as \\(2 + 2 + 2 + (n - 6)\\). Here, \\(n - 6\\) is even (since `n` is even and 6 is even) and at least 2 (since \\(n \\geq 8\\) implies \\(n - 6 \\geq 2\\)), so it is a valid positive even number.\n\nTherefore, the solution reduces to checking two conditions:\n- `n` must be even (`n % 2 == 0`)\n- `n` must be at least 8 (`n >= 8`)\n\nThe function implementation is straightforward:\n\n```rust\nfn is_equal_to_sum_even(n: isize) -> bool {\n    n % 2 == 0 && n >= 8\n}\n```\n\n**Examples**:\n- `is_equal_to_sum_even(4)` \u2192 `false` (4 < 8)\n- `is_equal_to_sum_even(6)` \u2192 `false` (6 < 8)\n- `is_equal_to_sum_even(8)` \u2192 `true` (8 is even and \u2265 8)\n\nThis solution efficiently checks the necessary and sufficient conditions with constant time complexity \\(O(1)\\).\n\n```rust\n/// Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers\nfn is_equal_to_sum_even(n: isize) -> bool {\n    n % 2 == 0 && n >= 8\n}\n```"]}
