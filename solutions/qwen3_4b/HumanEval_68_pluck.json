If there are no even values or the vector is empty, we return an empty vector.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Empty Vector**: If the input vector is empty, return an empty vector immediately.\n2. **Iterate Through the Vector**: For each element in the vector:\n   - **Check for Even Value**: Determine if the current element is even (i.e., `value % 2 == 0`).\n   - **Track Smallest Even Value**: If the current element is even:\n     - If no even value has been found yet, set the current element as the smallest even value with its index.\n     - Otherwise, compare the current element with the smallest even value found so far. If the current element is smaller, update the smallest even value and its index.\n3. **Return Result**: After processing all elements, if a smallest even value was found, return it along with its index as a vector of two `isize` values. Otherwise, return an empty vector.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn pluck(arr: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    if arr.is_empty() {\n        return vec![];\n    }\n\n    let mut min_even = None;\n    for (index, &value) in arr.iter().enumerate() {\n        if value % 2 == 0 {\n            if min_even.is_none() {\n                min_even = Some((value, index));\n            } else {\n                let (current_min, current_idx) = min_even.unwrap();\n                if value < current_min {\n                    min_even = Some((value, index));\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    min_even.map(|(value, index)| vec![value, index as isize])\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the input vector is empty. If so, it returns an empty vector immediately.\n2. **Tracking Minimum Even Value**: The function iterates through each element of the vector using `enumerate` to get both the index and value. For each even value encountered:\n   - If no even value has been processed yet (`min_even` is `None`), it initializes `min_even` with the current value and its index.\n   - If an even value has been processed, it compares the current value with the stored smallest even value. If the current value is smaller, it updates `min_even` with the current value and index.\n3. **Result Construction**: After processing all elements, if `min_even` contains a valid even value, it constructs and returns a vector containing the smallest even value and its index (converted to `isize`). If no even value was found, it returns an empty vector.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the vector in a single pass, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the vector. The space complexity is O(1) additional space (excluding the output vector).", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the smallest even value in a vector of non-negative integers and return it along with its smallest index. If there are no even values or the vector is empty, we return an empty vector.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize two variables, `min_even` (to store the smallest even value found) and `min_index` (to store the index of this value).\n2. **Iteration**: We iterate through each element in the vector using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value.\n3. **Check for Even Values**: For each value, we check if it is even (i.e., `val % 2 == 0`).\n4. **Update Minimum Even Value**: \n   - If `min_even` is `None` (indicating no even value has been found yet), we set `min_even` to the current value and `min_index` to the current index.\n   - If the current value is smaller than `min_even`, we update `min_even` and `min_index`.\n   - If the current value equals `min_even`, we do nothing (since we want the first occurrence of the smallest even value).\n5. **Result Construction**: After processing all elements, if `min_even` is still `None`, we return an empty vector. Otherwise, we return a vector containing `min_even` and `min_index`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn pluck(arr: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    let mut min_even = None;\n    let mut min_index = -1;\n\n    for (i, &val) in arr.iter().enumerate() {\n        if val % 2 == 0 {\n            if min_even.is_none() {\n                min_even = Some(val);\n                min_index = i;\n            } else {\n                if val < *min_even {\n                    min_even = Some(val);\n                    min_index = i;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    if min_even.is_none() {\n        Vec::new()\n    } else {\n        vec![*min_even, min_index]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: `min_even` starts as `None` to indicate no even value has been found yet, and `min_index` is initialized to `-1`.\n- **Iteration**: The loop processes each element in the vector along with its index.\n- **Even Check**: For each value, we check if it is even using `val % 2 == 0`.\n- **Updating Minimum**: \n  - If it's the first even value encountered, `min_even` and `min_index` are set to this value and its index.\n  - If a smaller even value is found later, `min_even` and `min_index` are updated.\n  - If an even value equal to `min_even` is found, we skip it (since we want the first occurrence).\n- **Result Handling**: After processing all elements, if no even value was found (`min_even` remains `None`), we return an empty vector. Otherwise, we return a vector containing the smallest even value and its index.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the vector in a single pass, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the vector.
