The function should return a new vector containing only the even numbers from the input vector.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves processing each element in the input vector to determine if it is even or odd. An even number is one that is divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`), while an odd number is not divisible by 2.\n2. **Key Insight**: For both positive and negative integers, the modulo operation in Rust correctly identifies even numbers (remainder 0) and odd numbers (non-zero remainder). For example:\n   - `2 % 2` results in `0` (even).\n   - `-2 % 2` results in `0` (even).\n   - `3 % 2` results in `1` (odd).\n   - `-3 % 2` results in `-1` (odd).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use Rust's standard library to efficiently filter the input vector. The `into_iter()` method converts the vector into an iterator, `filter()` selects elements that meet the condition (even numbers), and `collect()` gathers the filtered elements into a new vector.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn remove_odd(l: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    l.into_iter()\n        .filter(|x| x % 2 == 0)\n        .collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a vector of `isize` values (`l`).\n2. **Iteration and Filtering**: \n   - `l.into_iter()` converts the vector into an iterator, allowing efficient processing without copying the entire vector.\n   - `.filter(|x| x % 2 == 0)` checks each element `x` in the iterator. If `x` is even (i.e., `x % 2` equals 0), it is included in the result.\n3. **Result Construction**: The filtered elements are collected into a new vector using `.collect()`, which returns the result as a `Vec<isize>`.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input vector in linear time, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the vector. It handles both positive and negative integers correctly, ensuring all even numbers are retained while odd numbers are excluded. The solution leverages Rust's standard library for concise and readable code.", "\n\nThe problem asks for a \"rsthon\" function, which appears to be a typo for \"Rust\" (a programming language). Below is the correct Rust implementation to remove odd numbers from a vector of `isize` values:\n\n```rust\nfn remove_odd(l: Vec<isize>) -> Vec<isize> {\n    l.into_iter().filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0).collect()\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `l.into_iter()`: Converts the input vector into an iterator (taking ownership of the vector).\n- `.filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0)`: Keeps only elements where `x % 2 == 0` (even numbers). The `&` ensures we borrow the value (immutable reference) for the check.\n- `.collect()`: Collects the filtered elements into a new `Vec<isize>`.\n\n**Why this works:**\n- The modulus operation `% 2 == 0` correctly identifies even numbers (including negative evens like `-4` and zero).\n- This approach is idiomatic Rust, efficient, and concise.\n\n**Example usage:**\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let nums = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -2, 0];\n    let evens = remove_odd(nums);\n    println!(\"{:?}\", evens); // Output: [2, 4, -2, 0]\n}\n```\n\nThis function meets the requirement of removing odd numbers from the input vector and returns a new vector containing only the even numbers.", "\n\nThe problem asks to write a function to remove odd numbers from a vector of `isize` values.
