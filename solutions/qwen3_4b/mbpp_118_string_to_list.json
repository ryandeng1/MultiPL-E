The `String` type in Rust implements the `AsRef<str>` trait, so we can directly call `split` on it without explicit conversion to `&str`. \n\nThe `split` method splits the string at every occurrence of the space character, returning an iterator of substrings. Each substring is then converted to a `String` using `s.to_string()` and collected into a `Vec<String>`.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```rust\nfn string_to_list(string: String) -> Vec<String> {\n    string.split(' ').map(|s| s.to_string()).collect()\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `string.split(' ')`: Splits the input `String` into substrings wherever a space character (`' '`) is found.\n- `map(|s| s.to_string())`: Converts each substring (`&str`) to a `String`.\n- `collect()`: Collects the results into a `Vec<String>`.\n\nThis function handles:\n- Leading/trailing spaces (returns empty strings as separate elements).\n- Consecutive spaces (returns empty strings between them).\n- Empty input (returns a vector containing a single empty string).\n\nExample usage:\n```rust\nlet input = String::from(\"hello world\");\nlet result = string_to_list(input);\n// result = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\n```\n\n**Note:** The solution specifically splits on the ASCII space character (`' '`), not any whitespace (like tabs or newlines). This meets the requirement of splitting \"on the space character\".", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given string into a vector of strings by splitting it on each space character. The solution involves using Rust's string splitting capabilities to efficiently break the input string into substrings separated by spaces.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to split a string into a vector of substrings wherever a space character (`' '`) occurs. The split should not include the space characters in the resulting substrings.\n2. **Intuition**: Rust provides a built-in method `split` for strings that splits the string into substrings based on a specified delimiter (in this case, a space character).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Use the `split` method on the input `String` with the space character (`' '`) as the delimiter.\n   - Convert each resulting substring (a `&str`) into a `String` using `to_string()`.\n   - Collect all converted substrings into a `Vec<String>` using the `collect` method.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The `split` method operates in O(n) time where n is the length of the string. The `map` and `collect` operations also run in O(n) time. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), which is optimal for this problem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn string_to_list(string: String) -> Vec<String> {\n    string.split(' ').map(|s| s.to_string()).collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Splitting the String**: The `split(' ')` method splits the input `String` into an iterator of substrings. Each substring is a slice (`&str`) that does not include the space character used as the delimiter.\n2. **Converting Substrings to Strings**: The `map` function processes each substring from the iterator. For each substring `s`, `s.to_string()` converts it into a `String`.\n3. **Collecting Results**: The `collect` method gathers all the converted `String` values into a `Vec<String>`, which is then returned as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the splitting and conversion process, ensuring that the output is a vector of strings where each element is a substring of the original string split by spaces. The solution is concise, leverages Rust's standard library for string operations, and meets the problem requirements.", "\n\nTo convert a string to a vector of strings split on the space character, we can use Rust's string splitting capabilities. The solution involves splitting the input `String` using the space character `' '` as the delimiter and collecting each resulting substring into a `Vec<String>`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Split the String**: The `split` method is called on the input `String` with the space character `' '` as the delimiter. This method returns an iterator of substrings that are split at each occurrence of the space character.\n2. **Convert Substrings to Strings**: Each substring obtained from the split operation is converted from a `&str` to a `String` using the `to_string()` method.\n3. **Collect into Vector**: The converted `String` values are collected into a `Vec<String>`.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all cases, including leading, trailing, and consecutive spaces, by returning the exact substrings as they are split by the space character.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn string_to_list(string: String) -> Vec<String> {\n    string.split(' ').map(|s| s.to_string()).collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Splitting the String**: The `string.split(' ')` method splits the input `String` into an iterator of substrings wherever a space character `' '` is found. For example:\n  - `\"hello world\".split(' ')` yields the iterator `[\"hello\", \"world\"]`.\n  - `\"  hello  world  \".split(' ')` yields the iterator `[\"\", \"\", \"hello\", \"\", \"\", \"world\", \"\", \"\"]`.\n- **Converting to `String`**: Each substring from the split operation (a `&str`) is converted to a `String` using `s.to_string()`. This ensures each element in the resulting vector is a `String` rather than a `&str`.\n- **Collecting into Vector**: The `map` function transforms each substring into a `String`, and `collect()` gathers these `String` values into a `Vec<String>`.\n\nThis solution efficiently meets the requirement of splitting the input string on the space character and returning a vector of strings without any additional processing or trimming of empty strings, as specified by the problem."]}
