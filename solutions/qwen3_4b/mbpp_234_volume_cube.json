The volume of a cube is determined by raising the side length to the power of three (i.e., \\( \\text{side}^3 \\)).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires computing the volume of a cube from its side length. The side length is provided as an `isize` (a 64-bit signed integer in Rust).\n2. **Key Insight**: The volume of a cube is simply the side length multiplied by itself three times (i.e., \\( l \\times l \\times l \\)).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves a straightforward multiplication of the side length by itself twice. This is efficient with a constant time complexity \\( O(1) \\).\n4. **Edge Cases**: The problem does not specify constraints on the side length (e.g., non-negative values), so the solution handles all `isize` inputs as per standard arithmetic operations. Note that negative side lengths would result in a negative volume, but the problem context implies non-negative side lengths for a physical cube.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn volume_cube(l: isize) -> isize {\n    l * l * l\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `volume_cube` takes a parameter `l` of type `isize` (the side length of the cube) and returns an `isize` (the volume).\n- **Calculation**: The volume is computed as \\( l \\times l \\times l \\). This is achieved by multiplying the side length by itself twice in sequence.\n- **Efficiency**: The operation runs in constant time \\( O(1) \\) since it involves only three multiplications regardless of the input size.\n- **Handling Inputs**: The solution handles all valid `isize` inputs without additional checks, as the problem does not require validation of input values (e.g., ensuring the side length is non-negative).\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the volume of a cube by leveraging basic arithmetic operations, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of a cube given its side length.
