The result should be rounded to the next integer, which in this context means the ceiling of the calculated value (the smallest integer greater than or equal to the value).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The wind chill index is a measure of how cold it feels when wind is factored in with the actual air temperature. The problem specifies that the inputs are wind velocity in km/h and temperature in Celsius. The output must be an integer rounded to the next integer (ceiling).\n2. **Formula Selection**: The commonly used formula for the wind chill index in metric units (Celsius and km/h) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{WCI} = 13.12 + 0.7999 \\times T - 0.234 \\times T^2 - 0.000011 \\times T^2 \\times V + 0.0000002 \\times T \\times V + 0.000000001 \\times V^2\n   \\]\n   where \\(T\\) is the temperature in Celsius and \\(V\\) is the wind velocity in km/h.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Convert the integer inputs (wind velocity `v` and temperature `t`) to floating-point numbers to perform the calculations.\n   - Apply the wind chill formula using the converted values.\n   - Round the result to the next integer (ceiling) using the `ceil` function from the standard library.\n   - Convert the result back to an integer (isize) and return it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn wind_chill(v: isize, t: isize) -> isize {\n    let t_f64 = t as f64;\n    let v_f64 = v as f64;\n    let wci = 13.12 + 0.7999 * t_f64 - 0.234 * t_f64 * t_f64\n        - 0.000011 * t_f64 * t_f64 * v_f64\n        + 0.0000002 * t_f64 * v_f64\n        + 0.000000001 * v_f64 * v_f64;\n    (wci.ceil() as isize)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Conversion**: The integer values `v` (wind velocity in km/h) and `t` (temperature in Celsius) are converted to `f64` (64-bit floating-point numbers) to handle the precision required for the calculation.\n2. **Wind Chill Calculation**: The formula is applied using the converted values. The formula computes the wind chill index as a floating-point number:\n   - `13.12` is a constant term.\n   - `0.7999 * t` accounts for the linear effect of temperature.\n   - `-0.234 * t^2` accounts for the quadratic effect of temperature.\n   - `-0.000011 * t^2 * v` accounts for the combined effect of temperature and wind velocity.\n   - `0.0000002 * t * v` accounts for the linear interaction between temperature and wind velocity.\n   - `0.000000001 * v^2` accounts for the quadratic effect of wind velocity alone.\n3. **Rounding**: The result of the calculation is rounded up to the next integer using the `ceil` function. This ensures the output is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the computed value.\n4. **Output Conversion**: The rounded floating-point result is converted back to an `isize` (64-bit signed integer) and returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the wind chill index using a standard formula, ensures the result is rounded to the next integer (ceiling), and handles the input types appropriately.

The solution involves using a well-established formula for wind chill in the metric system (which uses km/h and Celsius) and then rounding the result to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The wind chill index is calculated using a specific formula that takes wind velocity (in km/h) and temperature (in Celsius) as inputs. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{WC} = 13.12 + 0.6215 \\times T - 11.37 \\times V^{0.16} + 0.3965 \\times T \\times V^{0.16}\n   \\]\n   where \\(T\\) is the temperature in Celsius and \\(V\\) is the wind velocity in km/h.\n2. **Key Insight**: The formula is valid for temperatures between -20\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C and wind speeds between 4.8 km/h and 120 km/h. The problem assumes inputs are within this valid range.\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Convert the input integers (wind velocity `v` and temperature `t`) to floating-point numbers for precise calculations.\n   - Compute \\(V^{0.16}\\) (where \\(V\\) is the wind velocity in km/h).\n   - Apply the wind chill formula to compute the result.\n   - Round the result to the nearest integer and convert it back to an `isize`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn wind_chill(v: isize, t: isize) -> isize {\n    let v_f = v as f64;\n    let t_f = t as f64;\n    let v_power = v_f.powf(0.16);\n    let wc = 13.12 + 0.6215 * t_f - 11.37 * v_power + 0.3965 * t_f * v_power;\n    wc.round() as isize\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Type Conversion**: The input integers `v` (wind velocity in km/h) and `t` (temperature in Celsius) are converted to `f64` to handle floating-point arithmetic accurately.\n2. **Exponentiation**: The wind velocity `v` is raised to the power of 0.16 (`v_power = v_f.powf(0.16)`) as part of the wind chill formula.\n3. **Wind Chill Calculation**: The formula is applied to compute the wind chill index (`wc`). The terms are:\n   - `13.12`: A constant term in the formula.\n   - `0.6215 * t_f`: A term proportional to the temperature.\n   - `-11.37 * v_power`: A term that accounts for the wind velocity's effect.\n   - `0.3965 * t_f * v_power`: A combined term for the interaction between temperature and wind velocity.\n4. **Rounding**: The computed wind chill index (`wc`) is rounded to the nearest integer using `round()`, which is then converted back to `isize` to match the required output type.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the wind chill index using the standard metric formula and ensures the result is rounded to the nearest integer as specified.
