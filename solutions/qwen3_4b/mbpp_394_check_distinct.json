Comparing `test_tup.len()` (the original vector length) with the set length determines if there are duplicates.\n\nThis solution efficiently checks for duplicates in O(n) average time complexity using a hash set, which is optimal for this task.\n\n**Note:** The `std::collections::HashSet` is imported via its full path to avoid requiring a separate `use` statement in the function context. In a real Rust file, you would typically add `use std::collections::HashSet;` at the top of the file for a cleaner implementation.", "\n\nTo check if a vector contains no duplicates, we can convert the vector into a `HashSet` and compare the length of the set with the length of the original vector.

If equal, there are no duplicates.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for duplicates in O(n) time complexity with O(n) space complexity, leveraging Rust's standard library.\n\n**Note:** The `HashSet` type is imported from `std::collections` in a full program, but the function body itself does not require explicit import statements as per the problem's focus on the function implementation.", "\n\nTo check if a given vector contains no duplicates, we can use a hash set to efficiently track elements.

The import is assumed to be handled outside the function (as is typical in Rust code).\n\nThis approach is concise, efficient, and leverages Rust's standard library for optimal performance."]}
