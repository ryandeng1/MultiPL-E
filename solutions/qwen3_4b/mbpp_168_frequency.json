The solution involves iterating through each element in the vector and incrementing a counter whenever the element matches `x`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a counter variable to zero. This counter will keep track of how many times `x` appears in the vector.\n2. **Iteration**: Loop through each element in the vector `a`.\n3. **Comparison**: For each element in the vector, check if it equals `x`.\n4. **Counting**: If an element matches `x`, increment the counter.\n5. **Return Result**: After processing all elements, return the counter value, which represents the total occurrences of `x` in the vector.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each element in the vector exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the vector. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a single counter variable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn frequency(a: Vec<isize>, x: isize) -> isize {\n    let mut count = 0;\n    for num in a {\n        if num == x {\n            count += 1;\n        }\n    }\n    count\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The counter `count` is initialized to 0.\n2. **Loop Through Vector**: The loop iterates over each element `num` in the vector `a`.\n3. **Check for Match**: For each element `num`, the code checks if `num` equals `x`.\n4. **Increment Counter**: If a match is found, the counter `count` is incremented by 1.\n5. **Return Result**: After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count`, which holds the total number of times `x` appears in the vector.\n\nThis solution efficiently counts the occurrences of `x` in the vector with minimal overhead, making it optimal for the given problem constraints. The use of a simple loop ensures clarity and correctness for the problem requirements.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of occurrences of a specific number `x` in a given vector `a`.
