The problem statement mentions \"remove uppercase substrings,\" but in the context of typical programming exercises, this usually means removing each individual uppercase character (since a single uppercase character is a substring of length 1 that is entirely uppercase). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to iterate through each character in the input string and exclude any characters that are uppercase (A-Z in the ASCII range, but also considering Unicode uppercase characters as per Rust's `is_uppercase` method).\n2. **Intuition**: For each character in the string, check if it is uppercase. If it is not uppercase, include it in the result string.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use Rust's iterator methods to efficiently process each character:\n   - Convert the input `String` into an iterator of `char` values.\n   - Filter out characters that are uppercase using the `is_uppercase` method.\n   - Collect the remaining characters into a new `String`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n) to store the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn remove_uppercase(str1: String) -> String {\n    str1.chars().filter(|c| !c.is_uppercase()).collect()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a `String` as input (`str1`).\n2. **Character Processing**: The input string is converted into an iterator of individual characters using `str1.chars()`.\n3. **Filtering Uppercase Characters**: Each character is checked for being uppercase using `is_uppercase()`. Characters that are **not** uppercase are retained.\n4. **Result Construction**: The filtered characters are collected into a new `String` using `collect()`.\n5. **Output**: The resulting `String` (with all uppercase characters removed) is returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the string in linear time, ensuring optimal performance while clearly meeting the problem's requirements. The solution handles Unicode characters correctly by leveraging Rust's built-in `is_uppercase` method, which adheres to Unicode standards. \n\n**Example**: \n- Input: `\"HelloWorld\"` \u2192 Output: `\"elloworld\"` (the 'H' and 'W' are removed)\n- Input: `\"Rust\"` \u2192 Output: `\"rst\"` (the 'R' is removed)", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to remove all uppercase substrings from a given string. However, in the context of this problem, \"uppercase substrings\" refers to each individual uppercase character (since a single uppercase letter is a substring of length 1). The solution involves iterating through each character in the string and keeping only those characters that are not uppercase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to process a string and exclude any uppercase letters (A-Z). Each uppercase letter is treated as a substring of length 1 that needs to be removed.\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each character in the string, we can check if a character is uppercase. If it is not uppercase, we include it in the result string.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use Rust's `chars()` method to convert the string into an iterator of characters.

The condition `!c.is_uppercase()` checks if a character is not uppercase.\n3. **Collecting Result**: The filtered characters are collected into a new `String` using the `collect()` method, which forms the result string without any uppercase characters.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input string in linear time, ensuring that all uppercase characters are removed while preserving the rest of the string's structure. The solution is concise and leverages Rust's standard library for optimal performance.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to remove all uppercase substrings from a given string. However, the term \"uppercase substrings\" in this context is interpreted as removing every individual uppercase letter (each of which is a substring of length 1). This interpretation aligns with common programming challenges where the goal is to remove all uppercase characters from a string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires processing each character in the input string. For each character, we check if it is an uppercase letter. If it is, we skip it; otherwise, we include it in the result.\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution leverages Rust's string handling capabilities. By iterating over each character in the string, we can filter out any uppercase characters using the `is_uppercase` method provided by Rust's standard library.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use the `chars()` method to convert the string into an iterator of individual characters.
