Both tuples are of type `(isize, isize, isize)`, meaning they each contain exactly three `isize` elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task involves comparing each corresponding element of two tuples of the same size (three elements each). For each index `i` (0, 1, 2), we need to verify that the element at position `i` in the second tuple is strictly smaller than the element at the same position in the first tuple.\n2. **Intuition**: Since the tuples are fixed-size (three elements), we can directly access each element using tuple indexing (e.g., `test_tup2.0` for the first element of `test_tup2`).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves three simple comparisons:\n   - Check if the first element of `test_tup2` is less than the first element of `test_tup1`.\n   - Check if the second element of `test_tup2` is less than the second element of `test_tup1`.\n   - Check if the third element of `test_tup2` is less than the third element of `test_tup1`.\n4. **Optimization**: The solution efficiently checks all three conditions in constant time, making it optimal for the given problem constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn check_smaller(test_tup1: (isize, isize, isize), test_tup2: (isize, isize, isize)) -> bool {\n    test_tup2.0 < test_tup1.0 && test_tup2.1 < test_tup1.1 && test_tup2.2 < test_tup1.2\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Signature**: The function `check_smaller` takes two tuples of three `isize` elements each as input parameters.\n- **Element Comparison**: The function checks three conditions:\n  - `test_tup2.0 < test_tup1.0`: Compares the first elements of both tuples.\n  - `test_tup2.1 < test_tup1.1`: Compares the second elements of both tuples.\n  - `test_tup2.2 < test_tup1.2`: Compares the third elements of both tuples.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns `true` only if all three comparisons are satisfied; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThis approach efficiently verifies the required condition with minimal computational overhead, leveraging Rust's tuple indexing for direct and clear element access.

Specifically, for each index `i` (0, 1, 2), the element at `test_tup2[i]` must be strictly less than `test_tup1[i]`.\n2. **Intuition**: Since the tuples are of fixed size and known structure, we can directly access each element using tuple indexing (field access) to perform the comparisons.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves three comparisons:\n   - `test_tup2.0 < test_tup1.0`\n   - `test_tup2.1 < test_tup1.1`\n   - `test_tup2.2 < test_tup1.2`\n   The function returns `true` only if all three comparisons are satisfied; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution involves a constant number of comparisons (three), making the time complexity O(1).
