The solution involves splitting the input string into words (using whitespace as delimiters) and then checking each word for the presence of the character 'z'.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Split the Input String**: The input string is split into individual words using the `split_whitespace` method. This method splits the string on whitespace and discards any empty strings, ensuring we only process valid words.\n2. **Check for 'z' in Each Word**: For each word obtained from the split, we check if it contains the character 'z' using the `contains` method. This method is case-sensitive, so it will only match the lowercase 'z' as specified in the problem.\n3. **Return Result**: If any word contains 'z', the function immediately returns `true`. If no words contain 'z' after checking all words, the function returns `false`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each word in the string for the presence of 'z' without unnecessary computations, leveraging Rust's iterator methods for concise and readable code.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn text_match_wordz(text: String) -> bool {\n    text.split_whitespace().any(|word| word.contains('z'))\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Splitting the String**: The `text.split_whitespace()` method splits the input string `text` into a sequence of words. For example, the string `\"hello zebra\"` is split into `[\"hello\", \"zebra\"]`.\n- **Checking for 'z'**: The `any` method is used on the iterator returned by `split_whitespace`. It checks each word in the iterator to see if any word contains the character 'z'. The lambda function `|word| word.contains('z')` evaluates to `true` if the word has 'z'.\n- **Early Termination**: The `any` method short-circuits, meaning it stops processing as soon as it finds the first word containing 'z', optimizing the solution for efficiency.\n\nThis solution efficiently addresses the problem by leveraging Rust's string and iterator capabilities to provide a clear, concise, and correct implementation. The function is case-sensitive, matching only the lowercase 'z' as specified.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string contains at least one word that includes the letter 'z' (case-sensitive). The key insight is that a \"word\" in this context refers to a sequence of alphabetic characters (letters) separated by non-alphabetic characters. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Tokenization by Alphabetic Characters**: Split the input string into tokens (words) where each token consists of contiguous alphabetic characters. Non-alphabetic characters (like spaces, numbers, punctuation) act as delimiters between tokens.\n2. **Check for 'z' in Tokens**: For each token obtained from the split, check if it contains the letter 'z' (lowercase). If any token contains 'z', return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we only consider sequences of letters as words and check for the presence of the lowercase 'z' in any of these words.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn text_match_wordz(text: String) -> bool {\n    text.split(|c| !c.is_alphabetic()).any(|token| token.contains('z'))\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tokenization**: The `split` method is used with a closure that checks if a character is not alphabetic (`!c.is_alphabetic()`). This splits the string into tokens of contiguous alphabetic characters.\n2. **Check for 'z'**: The `any` method is applied to the iterator of tokens to check if any token contains the letter 'z'. The `contains` method is used to verify the presence of 'z' in each token.\n3. **Case Sensitivity**: The solution is case-sensitive, meaning it only matches the lowercase 'z' as specified in the problem statement. Uppercase 'Z' (e.g., \"Z\") will not be considered.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the presence of the letter 'z' within any word (sequence of alphabetic characters) in the input string, meeting the problem's requirements precisely. \n\n**Example Usage**:\n- Input: `\"hello z world\"` \u2192 Output: `true` (token \"z\" contains 'z')\n- Input: `\"hello world\"` \u2192 Output: `false` (no token contains 'z')\n- Input: `\"z123\"` \u2192 Output: `true` (token \"z\" contains 'z')\n- Input: `\"Z\"` \u2192 Output: `false` (token \"Z\" does not contain 'z')", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string contains at least one word that includes the lowercase letter 'z'. The solution involves splitting the input string into individual words (using whitespace as the delimiter) and checking each word for the presence of the lowercase 'z'.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Split the Input String**: The input string is split into a list of words using `split_whitespace()`, which handles multiple spaces and skips empty strings.\n2. **Check for 'z' in Each Word**: For each word obtained from the split, we check if it contains the lowercase letter 'z' using the `contains()` method.\n3. **Return Result**: If any word contains the lowercase 'z', the function immediately returns `true`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `false`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each word in the string for the specified character without unnecessary complexity, ensuring optimal performance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn text_match_wordz(text: String) -> bool {\n    for word in text.split_whitespace() {\n        if word.contains('z') {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    false\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Splitting the String**: The `split_whitespace()` method splits the input string into a sequence of words separated by any whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.). This handles cases where there might be multiple spaces between words or leading/trailing spaces.\n2. **Checking for 'z'**: For each word in the split result, the function checks if the word contains the lowercase letter 'z' using `word.contains('z')`. This method efficiently checks for the presence of the character without converting the entire word to lowercase, ensuring case sensitivity as specified.\n3. **Early Termination**: If any word is found to contain 'z', the function returns `true` immediately, avoiding unnecessary checks for subsequent words.\n4. **Default Result**: If the loop completes without finding any word containing 'z', the function returns `false`.\n\nThis solution efficiently addresses the problem requirements by focusing on case-sensitive checks for the lowercase letter 'z' within words of the input string. The approach is straightforward and optimal for the given task."]}
