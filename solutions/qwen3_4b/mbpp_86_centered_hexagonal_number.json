The formula for the nth centered hexagonal number (where n starts at 1) is:\n\n**3 * n * (n - 1) + 1**\n\nThis formula works because:\n- For n = 1: 3 * 1 * (1 - 1) + 1 = 1\n- For n = 2: 3 * 2 * (2 - 1) + 1 = 7\n- For n = 3: 3 * 3 * (3 - 1) + 1 = 19\n\nThe function assumes `n` is a positive integer (n \u2265 1). If the input `n` is not positive, the formula still computes a value (e.g., n = 0 gives 1), but the problem context specifies \"nth\" centered hexagonal number, implying n \u2265 1.
