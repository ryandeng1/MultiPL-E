The conversion follows a specific rule where the first two human years are equivalent to 10.5 dog years each, and each subsequent human year is equivalent to 4 dog years. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires converting a given human age (in ` isize`) into dog years. The conversion rule is:\n   - For human ages up to 2 years: each human year equals 10.5 dog years.\n   - For human ages greater than 2 years: the first 2 human years count as 21 dog years (10.5 * 2), and each additional human year counts as 4 dog years.\n   \n2. **Key Insight**: \n   - For human ages \u2264 2, the dog age is calculated as `(human_age * 21) / 2` (to avoid floating-point operations and use integer arithmetic).\n   - For human ages > 2, the dog age is calculated as `21 + (human_age - 2) * 4`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - Check if the human age is \u2264 2. If so, compute the dog age using integer division to handle the fractional part (10.5 is represented as 21/2).\n   - Otherwise, compute the dog age using the linear formula for ages beyond 2 years.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn dog_age(h_age: isize) -> isize {\n    if h_age <= 2 {\n        (h_age * 21) / 2\n    } else {\n        21 + (h_age - 2) * 4\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **For human ages \u2264 2**: The calculation `(h_age * 21) / 2` effectively computes `h_age * 10.5` using integer arithmetic. For example:\n  - If `h_age = 1`, the result is `(1 * 21) / 2 = 21 / 2 = 10` (integer division truncates the fractional part).\n  - If `h_age = 2`, the result is `(2 * 21) / 2 = 42 / 2 = 21`.\n- **For human ages > 2**: The calculation `21 + (h_age - 2) * 4` accounts for the first 2 human years (21 dog years) and each additional human year (4 dog years). For example:\n  - If `h_age = 3`, the result is `21 + (3 - 2) * 4 = 21 + 4 = 25`.\n  - If `h_age = 4`, the result is `21 + (4 - 2) * 4 = 21 + 8 = 29`.\n\nThis approach efficiently converts human age to dog years using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations, ensuring correctness and simplicity. The solution handles all non-negative human ages as specified by the problem constraints.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate a dog's age in dog's years based on the given human age. The common rule used for this conversion is that the first two human years are equivalent to 10.5 dog years each, and each subsequent human year is equivalent to 4 dog years. The function should return an integer representing the dog's age in dog's years.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires converting a human age into an equivalent dog age using a specific conversion rule. The rule states:\n   - For human ages 0 to 2 years: Each human year is equivalent to 10.5 dog years.\n   - For human ages greater than 2 years: The first two human years count as 21 dog years (10.5 * 2), and each additional human year counts as 4 dog years.\n   \n2. **Key Insight**: Since the result must be an integer, we handle the conversion using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point inaccuracies. For human ages \u2264 2, the dog's age is calculated as `(human_age * 21) / 2` (which truncates the fractional part). For human ages > 2, the dog's age is `21 + (human_age - 2) * 4`.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves a simple conditional check:\n   - If the human age is 2 or less, compute the dog's age using integer division: `(human_age * 21) / 2`.\n   - Otherwise, compute the dog's age as `21 + (human_age - 2) * 4`.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The solution runs in constant time O(1) since it involves only basic arithmetic operations and a single conditional check, making it highly efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn dog_age(h_age: isize) -> isize {\n    if h_age <= 2 {\n        (h_age * 21) / 2\n    } else {\n        21 + (h_age - 2) * 4\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **For human ages \u2264 2**: The dog's age is calculated by multiplying the human age by 21 (to avoid floating-point operations) and then performing integer division by 2. This effectively truncates the fractional part (e.g., for 1 human year: `(1 * 21) / 2 = 10`).\n- **For human ages > 2**: The dog's age starts at 21 (equivalent to the first two human years) and adds 4 dog years for each additional human year (e.g., for 3 human years: `21 + (3 - 2) * 4 = 25`).\n\nThis approach efficiently converts human age to dog's age using integer arithmetic, ensuring accuracy and avoiding floating-point operations, which is crucial for the problem's requirements. The solution handles all valid non-negative human ages correctly.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a human age into an equivalent dog age based on a specific conversion rule. The rule states that the first two human years are equivalent to 10.5 dog years each, and each subsequent human year is equivalent to 4 dog years. The challenge is to compute this conversion efficiently and return an integer result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires converting a human age (given as an `isize`) into dog years. The conversion rule is:\n   - For ages 0 to 2 (inclusive): Each human year equals 10.5 dog years.\n   - For ages greater than 2: The first two human years count as 21 dog years (10.5 * 2), and each additional human year counts as 4 dog years.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: To avoid floating-point operations and ensure integer results, we can use integer arithmetic. Specifically:\n   - For ages \u2264 2: The formula `(h_age * 21 + 1) / 2` effectively rounds 10.5 * `h_age` to the nearest integer (rounding half up).\n   - For ages > 2: The formula `21 + (h_age - 2) * 4` directly computes the dog years without any fractional part.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution uses conditional checks to apply the appropriate formula. This approach ensures:\n   - Integer operations only (no floating-point conversions).\n   - Correct rounding for the first two years (rounding half up).\n   - Efficiency (constant time operations).\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn dog_age(h_age: isize) -> isize {\n    if h_age <= 2 {\n        (h_age * 21 + 1) / 2\n    } else {\n        21 + (h_age - 2) * 4\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Handling Ages \u2264 2**:\n   - The expression `(h_age * 21 + 1) / 2` computes the dog years for ages 0 to 2.\n   - Multiplying by 21 (which is `10.5 * 2`) and adding 1 before integer division by 2 ensures rounding half up. For example:\n     - When `h_age = 1`: `(1 * 21 + 1) / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11`.\n     - When `h_age = 2`: `(2 * 21 + 1) / 2 = 43 / 2 = 21` (integer division truncates to 21).\n\n2. **Handling Ages > 2**:\n   - The expression `21 + (h_age - 2) * 4` computes the dog years for ages greater than 2.\n   - The first 2 human years contribute 21 dog years (10.5 * 2), and each additional human year adds 4 dog years. For example:\n     - When `h_age = 3`: `21 + (3 - 2) * 4 = 21 + 4 = 25`.\n     - When `h_age = 4`: `21 + (4 - 2) * 4 = 21 + 8 = 29`.\n\nThis approach efficiently converts human age to dog age using integer arithmetic, ensuring accurate results without floating-point operations, and handles all valid human ages correctly.
