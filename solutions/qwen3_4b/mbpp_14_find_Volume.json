The volume of a triangular prism is derived from the formula: (base area of the triangle) multiplied by the height (length) of the prism. The base area of a triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height. Therefore, the volume of the triangular prism can be expressed as (base * height * length) / 2.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires computing the volume of a triangular prism given three dimensions: `l` (length of the prism), `b` (base of the triangle), and `h` (height of the triangle).\n2. **Key Insight**: The volume formula for a triangular prism is straightforward: (b * h * l) / 2. Since the problem specifies that the function should return an `isize`, we perform integer division (truncating any fractional part).\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves multiplying the three dimensions (`l`, `b`, and `h`) and then dividing the result by 2. This approach efficiently computes the volume using basic arithmetic operations.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The operations involved are constant time operations (O(1)), making the solution very efficient even for large input sizes (within the constraints of `isize`).\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn find_Volume(l: isize, b: isize, h: isize) -> isize {\n    (l * b * h) / 2\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Signature**: The function `find_Volume` takes three `isize` parameters: `l` (length of the prism), `b` (base of the triangle), and `h` (height of the triangle).\n- **Calculation**: The function computes the volume by multiplying the three dimensions (`l * b * h`) and then performing integer division by 2. This directly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism: (base area of the triangle) * (length of the prism).\n- **Integer Division**: Since the problem specifies that the result must be an `isize`, the division is performed as integer division, which truncates any fractional part. This is appropriate for the context where dimensions are integers and the volume is expected to be an integer (as per typical educational problem constraints).\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the volume using basic arithmetic operations, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements. The approach ensures correctness and simplicity for the given problem.", "\n\nThe function calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula:  \n`Volume = (base_area * height_of_prism)`, where `base_area = (l * b) / 2` (area of the triangular base).  \n\nThe implementation in Rust is straightforward:\n1. Multiply the base length `l` and the height of the triangle `b`.\n2. Perform integer division by 2 to get the triangular base area.\n3. Multiply the result by the prism height `h` to get the volume.\n\nThe function uses integer arithmetic (truncating any fractional part) as specified by the `isize` return type. The inputs are assumed to be non-negative (as volume cannot be negative).\n\n```rust\nfn find_Volume(l: isize, b: isize, h: isize) -> isize {\n    (l * b / 2) * h\n}\n```\n\n**Example**:  \nFor `l = 4`, `b = 3`, `h = 2`:  \n- Base area = `(4 * 3) / 2 = 6`  \n- Volume = `6 * 2 = 12`  \n\n**Note**: The problem statement mentions \"rsthon\" (a typo for Rust). The solution is written in Rust.", "\n\nTo calculate the volume of a triangular prism in Rust, we use the formula:\n\n$$\nV = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height of triangle} \\times \\text{length of prism}\n$$\n\nGiven the function parameters:\n- `l`: length of the prism (the distance between the two triangular bases)\n- `b`: base of the triangular base\n- `h`: height of the triangular base\n\nThe volume can be computed as:\n\n$$\nV = \\frac{l \\times b \\times h}{2}\n$$\n\nSince the problem specifies that the function returns an `isize`, we perform integer division. This ensures the result is an integer (truncated if necessary).\n\nHere's the correct Rust function:\n\n```rust\nfn find_Volume(l: isize, b: isize, h: isize) -> isize {\n    (l * b * h) / 2\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation:\n- Uses integer arithmetic to compute the volume.\n- Follows the standard formula for the volume of a triangular prism.\n- Handles the division by 2 as integer division (truncating any fractional part).\n\n**Note**: The problem statement mentions \"rsthon\", which is a typo for \"Rust\".
