The lateral surface area of a cube refers to the combined area of the four vertical faces (excluding the top and bottom faces). For a cube with side length `l`, the lateral surface area is calculated as `4 * l^2`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The lateral surface area of a cube is derived from the formula `4 * l * l`, where `l` is the side length of the cube. This formula accounts for the four vertical faces of the cube.\n2. **Intuition**: Since all faces of a cube are identical squares, the area of one face is `l * l`. Multiplying this by 4 gives the total area of the four vertical faces.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The solution involves a straightforward multiplication of the side length by itself and then multiplying the result by 4. This operation is efficient with constant time complexity O(1).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The operation involves basic arithmetic (multiplication), which runs in constant time O(1). The space complexity is also O(1) as no additional space is used beyond the input and output variables.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn lateralsurface_cube(l: isize) -> isize {\n    4 * l * l\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Definition**: The function `lateralsurface_cube` takes an `isize` parameter `l` representing the side length of the cube.\n- **Calculation**: The function computes the lateral surface area using the formula `4 * l * l`. This calculation directly gives the combined area of the four vertical faces of the cube.\n- **Return Value**: The result of the computation is returned as an `isize`, which is the lateral surface area of the cube.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired result with minimal operations, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements. The solution is optimal with constant time and space complexity.", "\n\nTo find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length, we note that a cube has six faces, each a square. The lateral surface area refers to the area of the four vertical faces (excluding the top and bottom faces). For a cube with side length `l`, each face has an area of `l * l`, so the lateral surface area is `4 * l * l`.\n\nThe function below implements this calculation efficiently. It takes the side length `l` as an `isize` and returns the lateral surface area as an `isize`. The multiplication `4 * l * l` is straightforward and handles both positive and negative inputs (though side lengths are typically non-negative in practice).\n\n```rust\nfn lateralsurface_cube(l: isize) -> isize {\n    4 * l * l\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- The expression `4 * l * l` computes the lateral surface area directly.\n- This works for all `isize` values (including negative numbers, though negative side lengths are not physically meaningful).\n- The function returns the result as an `isize`, matching the input type.\n\n**Example**:\n- If `l = 3`, the lateral surface area is `4 * 3 * 3 = 36`.\n- If `l = -2`, the result is `4 * (-2) * (-2) = 16` (the square ensures positivity).\n\nThis solution is concise, efficient, and adheres to the problem requirements."]}
