The sequence of decagonal numbers is defined by the formula:\n\n$$\nD(n) = 5n^2 - 5n + 1\n$$\n\nThis formula is consistent with the **OEIS sequence A001107**, which is titled *\"Decagonal numbers\"*. For example:\n\n- $ D(1) = 5(1)^2 - 5(1) + 1 = 1 $\n- $ D(2) = 5(4) - 10 + 1 = 11 $\n- $ D(3) = 5(9) - 15 + 1 = 31 $\n\nThis sequence is widely accepted in mathematical literature and programming contexts as the standard definition of decagonal numbers.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Why This Formula?\n\nThe confusion sometimes arises because there's another sequence called **10-gonal numbers** (A051604), which uses the formula:\n\n$$\nP(n) = 4n^2 - 3n\n$$\n\nHowever, the term **\"decagonal number\"** specifically refers to the sequence A001107 \u2014 the numbers that can be arranged in a decagon with `n` points on each side. Therefore, the correct formula for the **nth decagonal number** is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{5n^2 - 5n + 1}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Final Implementation\n\nGiven the problem statement asks to write a function to **find the nth decagonal number**, and the function is named `is_num_decagonal` (which may be a bit misleading, but we'll follow the task), the correct implementation in Rust is:\n\n```rust\nfn is_num_decagonal(n: isize) -> isize {\n    5 * n * n - 5 * n + 1\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` (the position in the sequence) and returns the corresponding decagonal number.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Example Usage\n\n```rust\nprintln!(\"{}\", is_num_decagonal(1)); // Output: 1\nprintln!(\"{}\", is_num_decagonal(2)); // Output: 11\nprintln!(\"{}\", is_num_decagonal(3)); // Output: 31\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Final Answer\n\n```rust\nfn is_num_decagonal(n: isize) -> isize {\n    5 * n * n - 5 * n + 1\n}\n```", "\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the **nth decagonal number**, we need to understand what a decagonal number is.

It is also consistent with the definition of decagonal numbers in many educational and programming contexts.\n\nFor example:\n- For $ n = 1 $: $ 5(1)^2 - 5(1) + 1 = 1 $\n- For $ n = 2 $: $ 5(2)^2 - 5(2) + 1 = 20 - 10 + 1 = 11 $\n- For $ n = 3 $: $ 5(3)^2 - 5(3) + 1 = 45 - 15 + 1 = 31 $\n\nThese values match the known decagonal numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation in Rust\n\nGiven the function signature:\n\n```rust\nfn is_num_decagonal(n: isize) -> isize {\n```\n\nWe can directly implement the formula using integer arithmetic.\n\nHere's the final implementation:\n\n```rust\nfn is_num_decagonal(n: isize) -> isize {\n    5 * n * n - 5 * n + 1\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` and returns the **nth decagonal number** using the correct formula.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```rust\nfn is_num_decagonal(n: isize) -> isize {\n    5 * n * n - 5 * n + 1\n}\n```", "\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the **nth decagonal number**, we begin by understanding what a decagonal number is.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Understanding Decagonal Numbers\n\nDecagonal numbers are a type of **polygonal number** that can be represented as a decagon (a 10-sided polygon). The general formula for the **k-gonal number** is:\n\n$$\nP(k, n) = \\frac{n \\cdot ((k - 2) \\cdot n - (k - 4))}{2}\n$$\n\nFor **decagonal numbers**, $ k = 10 $. Substituting into the formula:\n\n$$\nP(10, n) = \\frac{n \\cdot (8n - 6)}{2} = n \\cdot (4n - 3)\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\nP(10, n) = 4n^2 - 3n\n$$\n\nSo, the **nth decagonal number** is given by the expression:\n\n$$\n\\text{decagonal}(n) = 4n^2 - 3n\n$$\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Implementation in Rust\n\nWe'll write a function that takes an ` isize` (a signed integer type) and returns the corresponding decagonal number using the derived formula.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```rust\nfn is_num_decagonal(n: isize) -> isize {\n    4 * n * n - 3 * n\n}\n```\n\nThis function computes the **nth decagonal number** correctly for all valid inputs (positive integers).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Example Outputs\n\n| n | Decagonal Number |\n|---|------------------|\n| 1 | $ 4(1)^2 - 3(1) = 1 $ |\n| 2 | $ 4(4) - 6 = 10 $ |\n| 3 | $ 4(9) - 9 = 27 $ |\n| 4 | $ 4(16) - 12 = 52 $ |\n\nThese match the expected values from the formula.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Note on Function Name\n\nThe function name `is_num_decagonal` might be slightly misleading\u2014it suggests checking if a number is decagonal, but the problem explicitly asks to **find** the nth decagonal number. This discrepancy is likely due to a naming convention issue in the problem statement. However, based on the instructions, we implement the function as described.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer\n\n```rust\nfn is_num_decagonal(n: isize) -> isize {\n    4 * n * n - 3 * n\n}\n```"]}
