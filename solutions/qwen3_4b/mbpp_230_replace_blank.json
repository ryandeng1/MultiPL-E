The solution involves iterating through each character in the input string and constructing a new string where each space character is replaced by the given character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires processing a string (`str1`) and replacing all occurrences of the space character (`' '`) with another character provided as a `String` (which is expected to be a single character).\n2. **Intuition**: By iterating through each character in the input string, we can check if the character is a space. If it is, we append the replacement character to the result string; otherwise, we append the original character.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use an iterative approach to process each character in the string. This ensures that we handle each character individually and replace spaces as required.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The algorithm processes each character in the string exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n) for storing the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn replace_blank(str1: String, char: String) -> String {\n    let mut result = String::new();\n    for c in str1.chars() {\n        if c == ' ' {\n            result.push_str(&char);\n        } else {\n            result.push(c);\n        }\n    }\n    result\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by creating an empty `String` (`result`) to build the output.\n2. **Iteration**: For each character (`c`) in the input string (`str1`):\n   - **Check for Space**: If the character `c` is a space (`' '`), we append the replacement character (from `char`) to `result`.\n   - **Non-Space Characters**: If the character is not a space, we directly append it to `result`.\n3. **Result Construction**: After processing all characters, the `result` string contains all the original characters with spaces replaced by the specified character, which is then returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the string in linear time, ensuring that all spaces are replaced as required while maintaining the integrity of the rest of the string. The solution is straightforward and leverages Rust's string handling capabilities for clarity and correctness.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write a function that takes a string and a character (represented as a `String`), replaces all blank spaces (space characters) in the input string with the given character, and returns the modified string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The function should replace every occurrence of the space character (`' '`) in the input string `str1` with the character provided in `char` (which is a `String` of length 1). \n2. **Key Insight**: Rust's `String` type provides a built-in method `replace` that can be used to replace all occurrences of a substring (in this case, a space character) with another substring (the given character).\n3. **Implementation**: \n   - Convert the `char` `String` into a string slice using `as_str()` for the `replace` method.\n   - Use the `replace` method on `str1` to replace every space character (`\" \"`) with the string slice from `char`.\n4. **Edge Cases**: \n   - If `char` is an empty string, the function will return the original string (though the problem specifies a \"character\", so this case is unlikely).\n   - The function assumes the input `char` is a single character (as per the problem statement).\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn replace_blank(str1: String, char: String) -> String {\n    str1.replace(\" \", char.as_str())\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Signature**: The function `replace_blank` takes two parameters: `str1` (the input string) and `char` (the character to replace spaces with, as a `String`).\n- **String Replacement**: The `replace` method is called on `str1` with two arguments:\n  - `\" \"`: The substring to be replaced (a space character).\n  - `char.as_str()`: The string slice of the given `char` (which is a single character).\n- **Result**: The method returns a new `String` where all space characters in `str1` have been replaced by the character from `char`.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages Rust's built-in string methods to achieve the desired result with minimal code, ensuring clarity and correctness for the given problem constraints.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to replace all blank spaces (space characters) in a given string with a specified character. The solution involves efficiently processing the input string to replace each space character with the provided character string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task requires replacing every occurrence of the space character (`' '`) in the input string `str1` with the given `char` string. The key observation here is that the `char` string is expected to be a single character (as per the problem statement), but the solution handles it generically by treating it as a string.\n2. **Insight**: Rust's `String` type provides a built-in method `replace` that can replace all occurrences of a substring (in this case, a single space character) with another string. This method is efficient and concise for the given problem.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Using the `replace` method on the `String` object is the most straightforward approach. The method takes two parameters: the substring to replace (`\" \"`) and the replacement string (`char.as_str()`). This method efficiently processes the entire string in linear time.\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity of the `replace` method is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is optimal for this problem as each character in the string is processed exactly once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn replace_blank(str1: String, char: String) -> String {\n    str1.replace(\" \", char.as_str())\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Signature**: The function `replace_blank` takes two `String` parameters: `str1` (the input string) and `char` (the character string to replace spaces with).\n2. **String Replacement**: The `replace` method is called on `str1` with two arguments:\n   - The first argument is a string slice `\" \"` representing the space character to be replaced.\n   - The second argument is `char.as_str()`, which converts the `char` string into a string slice for the replacement.\n3. **Result**: The method returns a new `String` where all space characters in `str1` have been replaced with the characters from `char`. For example, if `str1` is `\"hello world\"` and `char` is `\"x\"`, the result will be `\"helloworld\"` (note: the example uses a single character for clarity; the solution handles any string length as specified).\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages Rust's string operations to solve the problem with minimal code and optimal performance. The solution is both concise and robust for the given problem constraints."]}
