The solution involves checking if the month number corresponds to one of the months that have 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem specifies that the input is a month number between 1 and 12. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).\n2. **Key Insight**: For any given month number in the range 1-12, we can directly check if it matches 4, 6, 9, or 11.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The simplest approach is to use a conditional check (using logical OR operations) to verify if the input month number is one of the four months with 30 days. This approach is efficient with constant time complexity O(1) and is straightforward to implement.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn check_monthnumber_number(monthnum3: isize) -> bool {\n    monthnum3 == 4 || monthnum3 == 6 || monthnum3 == 9 || monthnum3 == 11\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Function Signature**: The function `check_monthnumber_number` takes an `isize` parameter `monthnum3` (representing the month number) and returns a `bool`.\n- **Condition Check**: The function checks if `monthnum3` is equal to 4, 6, 9, or 11. If any of these conditions are true, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution uses a direct comparison with four constants, resulting in constant time O(1) complexity, which is optimal for this problem.\n- **Correctness**: The solution correctly identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) and returns `true` for these months, while returning `false` for all other months (1-12).\n\nThis approach efficiently and correctly checks whether the given month number has 30 days by leveraging simple conditional logic.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given month number (ranging from 1 to 12) has exactly 30 days.

If any of these conditions are true, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution operates in constant time O(1) since it involves only simple comparisons without any loops or additional data structures.\n- **Validity**: The problem specifies that the input month number is between 1 and 12, so no additional validation is necessary.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the presence of 30-day months by leveraging direct comparisons, ensuring clarity and optimal performance.", "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given month number (ranging from 1 to 12) has exactly 30 days. The solution involves checking if the month number corresponds to one of the months that have 30 days in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). All other months (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) have either 31 days or 28/29 days (February).\n2. **Key Insight**: The solution requires checking if the input month number is one of the four specific values (4, 6, 9, 11). If it matches any of these values, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: The simplest approach is to use a conditional check to see if the input month number equals 4, 6, 9, or 11. This avoids the need for complex logic or additional data structures.\n\n### Solution Code\n```rust\nfn check_monthnumber_number(monthnum3: isize) -> bool {\n    match monthnum3 {\n        4 | 6 | 9 | 11 => true,\n        _ => false,\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The function takes an `isize` parameter `monthnum3`, which represents the month number (1 to 12 as per the problem statement).\n- **Condition Check**: Using a `match` expression, the function checks if `monthnum3` is 4, 6, 9, or 11. If it is, the function returns `true` (indicating 30 days). For any other value (within the valid range 1-12), it returns `false`.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution operates in constant time O(1) since it involves only a single comparison operation.\n- **Edge Cases**: The problem specifies that the input is between 1 and 12, so no additional validation for invalid inputs is necessary.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the months with 30 days using a straightforward conditional match, ensuring correctness and optimal performance."]}
