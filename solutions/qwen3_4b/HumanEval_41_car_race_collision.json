Each car moves at the same speed, and collisions are defined as when an LCR car meets an RCL car. Importantly, the cars are infinitely sturdy and continue moving in their original directions after a collision.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nSince all cars move at the same speed and the LCR and RCL cars start far apart, **every LCR car will eventually meet every RCL car exactly once**. This is because:\n\n- The relative motion between LCR and RCL cars ensures that each pair will intersect once.\n- The fact that the cars pass through each other (not reversing direction) means that **each such intersection counts as one collision**.\n\nThus, for $ n $ LCR cars and $ n $ RCL cars, the total number of collisions is simply:\n\n$$\nn \\times n = n^2\n$$\n\nThis holds true regardless of the initial spacing (as long as the cars start far enough apart to ensure all pairs collide), which is guaranteed by the problem statement.\n\n---\n\n### Example Cases\n\n- **$ n = 1 $**: One LCR and one RCL \u2192 1 collision \u2192 $ 1^2 = 1 $\n- **$ n = 2 $**: Two LCR and two RCL \u2192 4 collisions \u2192 $ 2^2 = 4 $\n- **$ n = 3 $**: Three LCR and three RCL \u2192 9 collisions \u2192 $ 3^2 = 9 $\n\nThese examples confirm the pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Code\n\n```rust\nfn car_race_collision(n: isize) -> isize {\n    n * n\n}\n```\n\nThis function computes the number of collisions as $ n^2 $, which matches the expected behavior for all valid inputs.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer\n\n```rust\nfn car_race_collision(n: isize) -> isize {\n    n * n\n}\n```"]}
